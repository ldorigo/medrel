Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring body mass index (body mass index), waist circumference (also with abdominal computed tomography), blood pressure, and daily calorie intake (3-day diary). Chronotypes were assessed through the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A determination and HLA typing were performed. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (all HLA DQB1*0602 positive and with cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels < 110 pg/mL) had a higher body mass index and body mass index-independent metabolic alterations, namely waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose/insulin ratio (an insulin resistance index), with respect to patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels > 300 pg/mL). Despite lower daily food intake, patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy displayed significant alterations in metabolic parameters resulting in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in more than half the cases. body mass index-independent metabolic alterations and the relative hypophagia of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, as compared with patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time, suggest that orexin-A influences the etiology of this phenotype. Moreover, considering that these dysmetabolic alterations are present from a young age, a careful metabolic follow-up of patients diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy is mandatory.\n"

      "Processing abstract: Sleep and daytime sleepiness in methylphenidate medicated and un-medicated children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder).  Significantly higher levels of daytime sleepiness were reported by the parents of the un-medicated children between the hours of 13:00 and 15:00, compared to the medicated children. The medicated children became increasingly sleepier from the first to the second measurement in both the morning and afternoon. There was no significant difference in the number of sleep disorders/disruptions reported by the parents of either group. In a group of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder taking methylphenidate, there was a significant increase in sleepiness a few hours after taking the medication, which may then have a significant impact on their learning. The data also imply that part of the mechanism of action of methylphenidate effects in these children may be by reduction of daytime sleepiness.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Roles of parental sleep/wake patterns, socioeconomic status, and daytime activities in the sleep/wake patterns of children.  Our best-fitting models explained 40% to 71% variances of various sleep/wake patterns of the children, which were influenced by a web of interactive factors including school start time, parental sleep/wake patterns, sociodemographics, and daytime activities. The strongest predictor of various sleep/wake patterns was school start time. Higher socioeconomic status would shorten TIB of both children and parents, but through different pathways (by advancing wakeup time and delaying bedtime in children but by delaying bedtime in parents). Media use and homework shortened TIB of children, while leisure extracurricular activities and later school start time lengthened it. The age and sex effects on sleep/wake patterns, at least in part, were mediated by daytime activities. Daytime activities of children also influenced their parental sleep/wake patterns, especially their maternal one. A consistent pattern of stronger mother-child than father-child associations were found in various sleep/wake patterns. There was a complex and interactive relationship among school schedule, parental sleep/wake patterns, socioeconomic status, and daytime activities in determining the sleep/wake patterns of children. These findings have important clinical implications for the management of childhood sleep/wake habits and problems.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Symptomatic narcolepsy in patients with neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis: new neurochemical and immunological implications.  Bilateral and symmetrical hypothalamic lesions associated with marked or moderate hypocretin deficiency were found in all 7 cases. Four of these patients met the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 2 narcolepsy criteria. Three patients, including 2 patients with narcolepsy, were seropositive for anti-aquaporin 4 antibody and diagnosed as having neuromyelitis optica-related disorder. Since aquaporin 4 is highly expressed in the hypothalamic periventricular regions, an immune attack on aquaporin 4 may be partially responsible for the bilateral and hypothalamic lesions and hypocretin deficiency in narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness associated with autoimmune demyelinating diseases.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prevalence and correlates of depression with atypical symptoms in Hong Kong.  The 12 month prevalence of atypical depression was 1.3%. Compared to non-atypical depression, atypical depression was associated with female gender, soft (subthreshold) bipolar II disorder, family psychiatric history, higher suicidality, more help-seeking from psychiatrists, and more depressive and manic/hypomanic symptoms. There was no difference in levels of distress or impairment. Although limited by the lack of detailed information on comorbidity, bipolar family history, and age of onset, the findings support the hypothesis that atypical depression among Chinese people in Hong Kong exhibited prevalence and correlates similar to those found in Western epidemiological and clinical studies. Further research is warranted to examine its association with hypomania and how atypical depression may occupy a nosological position between typical unipolar depression and bipolar spectrum disorders.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Treatment of sleep disorders after traumatic brain injury.  Abnormal sleep studies were found in 22 subjects (39%), of whom 13 (23%) had obstructive sleep apnea, 2 (3%) had posttraumatic hypersomnia, 3 (5%) had narcolepsy, 4 (7%) had periodic limb movements in sleep, and 12 had objective excessive daytime sleepiness with multiple sleep latency test score < 10 minutes. Apneas, hypopneas, and snoring were eliminated by continuous positive airway pressure in obstructive sleep apnea subjects, but there was no significant change in multiple sleep latency test scores. Periodic limb movements were eliminated with pramipexole. One of 3 narcolepsy subjects and 1 of 2 posttraumatic hypersomnia subjects had resolution of hypersomnia with modafinil. There was no significant change in Functional Outcome of Sleep Questionnaire, Profile of Mood States, or Psychomotor Vigilance Test results after treatment. Treatment of sleep disorders after traumatic brain injury may result in polysomnographic resolution without change in sleepiness or neuropsychological function.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Safety overview of postmarketing and clinical experience of sodium oxybate (Xyrem): abuse, misuse, dependence, and diversion.  Approximately 26,000 patients worldwide received sodium oxybate from first market introduction in 2002 through March 2008. Of those 26,000 patients, 0.2% reported > or = 1 of the events studied. These included 10 cases (0.039%) meeting DSM-IV abuse criteria, 4 cases (0.016%) meeting DSM-IV dependence criteria, 8 cases (0.031%, including 3 of the previous 4) with withdrawal symptoms reported after discontinuation of sodium oxybate, 2 confirmed cases (0.008%) of sodium oxybate-facilitated sexual assault, 8 cases (0.031%) of overdose with suicidal intent, 21 deaths (0.08%) in patients receiving sodium oxybate treatment with 1 death known to be related to sodium oxybate, and 3 cases (0.01%) of traffic accidents involving drivers taking sodium oxybate. During this period, approximately 600,000 bottles of sodium oxybate were distributed, and 5 incidents (0.0009%) of diversion were reported. Cumulative postmarketing and clinical experience indicates a very low risk of abuse/misuse of sodium oxybate.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The Epworth score in African American populations. African Americans have elevated scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) compared to whites. The reason for this difference is not clear. African Americans in the clinic-based population had a higher mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score than whites (11.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.3, p < 0.0001). This difference persisted after adjusting for sleepiness risk factors. In adjusted analyses including responses to the other Epworth Sleepiness Scale questions, African Americans scored significantly greater on 3 of the 8 Epworth Sleepiness Scale component questions: questions 2-\"Watching TV,\" 6-\"Sitting and talking to someone,\" and 7-\"Sitting quietly after lunch without alcohol.\" In the validation cohort, African Americans also had a higher mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (9.1 +/- 0.3, vs. 8.2 +/- 0.3, p = 0.04). In addition they had significantly elevated scores on questions 6 and 7 (p = 0.0002, p = 0.012 respectively) even after adjusting for responses to the other Epworth questions. African Americans have greater sleepiness than whites as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale; this is independent of sleepiness risk factors. The difference appears due primarily to differences in responses to questions 6 and 7 of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale questions suggesting a difference in the interpretation of these 2 questions.\n",

The prevalence of \"maintaining a regular schedule\" increased with age. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule had negative associations with excessive daytime sleepiness, whereas snacking on food and/or beverages had a positive association. Having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule were identified as favorable non-pharmacological self-management practices for reducing excessive daytime sleepiness, whereas snacking on food and/or beverages was considered to be an unfavorable non-pharmacological self-management practice.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The economic consequences of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a typical onset in childhood or early adulthood. Narcolepsy may have serious negative effects on health-, social-, education-, and work-related issues for people with narcolepsy and for their families. The disease may, thus, present a significant socioeconomic burden, but no studies to date have addressed the indirect and direct costs of narcolepsy. Patients with narcolepsy had significantly higher rates of health-related contact and medication use and higher expenses, as compared with control subjects. They also had higher unemployment rates. The income level of patients with narcolepsy who were employed was lower than that of employed control subjects. The annual total direct and indirect costs were euro 11,654 (euro = Eurodollars) for patients with narcolepsy and euro 1430 for control subjects (p < 0.001), corresponding to an annual mean excess health-related cost of euro 10,223 for each patient with narcolepsy. In addition, the patients with narcolepsy received an annual social transfer income of euro 2588. The study confirms that narcolepsy has major socioeconomic consequences for the individual patient and for society. Early diagnosis and treatment could potentially reduce disease burden, which would have a significant socioeconomic impact.\n",

Of 2,497 (72%) responders, 45.2% reported nasal congestion. Self-reported nasal blockage was significantly associated with an increased risk of sleep-disordered breathing symptoms: snoring (odds ratio [OR] 1.9), witnessed apnoea (OR, 2.2) and unrefreshing sleep (OR, 1.7). Those with nasal blockage had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (5.5 +/- 3.6 vs. 3.9 +/- 3.3, p<0.001) compared with those without nasal blockage. Nasal blockage was associated with increased risk of doziness in seven out of eight items of Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Oxygen desaturation index and apnoea-hypopnoea index were similar between subjects with and without self-reported nasal blockage. Self-reported nasal blockage is a common symptom in employed Pakistani adults. Self-reported nasal blockage is significantly associated with symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and excessive daytime sleepiness but not with respiratory variables on overnight sleep monitoring.\n",

During global cataplectic attacks, EMG showed suppression of activity alternated with patterned enhancement, enhanced EMG activity in neck muscles preceding that of other cranial, axial and lower limb muscles. This waxing and waning EMG pattern ended with a complete body collapse and persistent muscle atonia. Breathing irregularities, heart rate (heart rate) instability and EEG desynchronization were observed during global cataplectic attacks without any appreciable blood pressure changes, but with heart rate deceleration and silencing of sympathetic skin response while in complete atonia.

Quantity of night sleep is shorter than 8 h in several developed countries, but similar data is not available for most African countries. The objective of this study was to describe the quantity of night sleep, factors that are associated with non-restorative sleep, and sleep habits in a population of undergraduates in Nigeria. Mean duration of night sleep was 6.2 h (median 6.0, range 4.5-9.3), while mean duration of daytime naps was 70 min (median 75, range 10-315). Duration of night sleep was associated with day of the week and gender, but not with BMI. Non-restorative sleep, which occurred 25% of total sleep times, was associated with night sleep < or =5 h, hypnotic use, alarm to wake, heavy workload, and afternoon naps. Intra-night sleep awakening occurred 58.5% of total sleep times. Afternon naps were taken by 225 (82%) of subjects. Duration of night sleep in this African population is not longer than the duration in Western countries. Intra-night awakening and non-restorative sleep; however, occur more frequently, and afternoon nap is usually in excess of 1 h.\n",

Sleep disorders and sleep-apnea/hypopnea syndromes are very frequent in women, being misdiagnosed in many cases. The menopause, regardless of age, is associated to poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness that can lead to impaired quality of life, and reduced productivity and functioning. Mean age of surveyed women was 47.6+/-5.5 years, with 67.8% having less than 12 years of schooling, 33.6% being postmenopausal, and 2.7% on hormone therapy. A 10.1% were current smokers and 20.8% were sedentary. According to the Menopause Rating Scale (item 1) 51.7% presented hot flushes, which were graded as severe-very severe in 42.8% of cases. Regarding the partner (n=132), erectile dysfunction was present in 10.6%, premature ejaculation 6.1% and 17.4% abused alcohol. Mean total Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 8+/-4.4 (median 8), with 33.6% considered having some degree of daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >or=10). Logistic regression analysis determined that postmenopausal status (OR 6.58, CI 95% [2.51-17.23], p=0.001), sedentarism (OR 3.43, CI 95% [1.14-10.26], p=0.02) and hot flush presence (OR 2.61, CI 95% [1.02-6.65], p=0.04) among women were risk factors for increased daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale total score >or=10) whereas partner faithfulness decreased this risk (OR 0.47, CI 95% [0.24-0.90], p=0.02).

Metabolic parameters were evaluated by measuring body mass index (body mass index), waist circumference (also with abdominal computed tomography), blood pressure, and daily calorie intake (3-day diary). Chronotypes were assessed through the morningness-eveningness questionnaire. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A determination and HLA typing were performed. Patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (all HLA DQB1*0602 positive and with cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels < 110 pg/mL) had a higher body mass index and body mass index-independent metabolic alterations, namely waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose/insulin ratio (an insulin resistance index), with respect to patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (cerebrospinal fluid orexin-A levels > 300 pg/mL). Despite lower daily food intake, patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy displayed significant alterations in metabolic parameters resulting in a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in more than half the cases. body mass index-independent metabolic alterations and the relative hypophagia of patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, as compared with patients with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time, suggest that orexin-A influences the etiology of this phenotype. Moreover, considering that these dysmetabolic alterations are present from a young age, a careful metabolic follow-up of patients diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy is mandatory.\n",

      "Processing abstract: A brain PET study in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy. Recent insights in pathophysiology have demonstrated that narcolepsy-cataplexy is caused by early loss of hypothalamus hypocretin neurons. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying sleepiness and the dramatic cataplexy reaction to positive emotion remain unclear. The authors found significant hypermetabolism in narcolepsy-cataplexy in fully awake condition in the limbic cortex specifically in the anterior and mid cingulate cortex, in the right cuneus and lingual gyrus. In contrast, no hypometabolism was found. Hypermetabolism was detected in the cerebellum and pre-postcentral gyri in treated compared with untreated patients. During cataplectic attacks, cerebral metabolism significantly increased in the bilateral pre-postcentral gyri, primary somatosensory cortex, with a marked decrease in the hypothalamus. Hypermetabolism was found in the executive network in narcolepsy at baseline in fully awake condition. Wake state assessment during scanning appears critical to avoid results showing altered functional neurocircuitry secondary to sleepiness and not to the underlying neurological disorder per se. Finally, cataplexy attacks were characterised by a hypometabolism in the hypothalamus associated with wide bilateral brain area hypermetabolisms.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep-related breathing and sleep-wake disturbances in ischemic stroke. Sleep-related breathing disturbances (Sleep-related breathing disturbances) and sleep-wake disturbances (sleep-wake disturbances) are often neglected in stroke patients. Recent studies suggest that they are frequent and have an impact on stroke outcome. Sleep-related breathing disturbances, presenting with obstructive, central, or mixed apneas, is present in 50%-70% of stroke patients. We recommend screening for Sleep-related breathing disturbances in all stroke patients by respirography. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for obstructive Sleep-related breathing disturbances, which reverses the vascular risk of the patients. In the absence of controlled trials, CPAP treatment should be reserved for patients with severe obstructive Sleep-related breathing disturbances, daytime symptoms (e.g., sleepiness), or high cardiovascular risk profile. Oxygen and adaptive servoventilation may be used for central Sleep-related breathing disturbances. sleep-wake disturbances including insomnia, disturbances of wakefulness (hypersomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue), sleep-related movement disorders (restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movements during sleep), and parasomnias (REM sleep behavior disorder) are found in 10%-50% of patients. sleep-wake disturbances are associated with cognitive disturbances and may compromise neurologic recovery. Hypnotics and sedative antidepressants may aggravate Sleep-related breathing disturbances and neurologic recovery and should be used with caution. For disturbances of wakefulness, dopaminergic drugs, modafinil, or activating antidepressants may be considered. Poststroke sleep-related movement disorders can be treated with dopaminergic drugs; REM sleep behavior disorder with clonazepam. Sleep-related breathing disturbances and sleep-wake disturbances are frequent conditions that affect stroke outcome. In view of existing treatment options, these conditions deserve the neurologist's awareness.\n",

Reports of insomnia were a significant predictor of all five daytime functioning measures, which is consistent with previous research. We also showed that reports of insomnia were able to uniquely explain a significant amount of variability in self-reported daytime functioning after controlling for demographics, health, and sleep diary variables. The pattern of individual variables that reached significance in the first three sets varied depending on which daytime functioning measure was predicted, however, age, the presence of pain, the presence of mental health problems, SOL, and WASO were the most commonly significant predictors of poor daytime functioning from these sets across measures. Individuals' perceptions of their sleep are related to differences in their reported daytime functioning, which are not accounted for by demographic factors, health surveys, or quantitative sleep assessments. Reports of insomnia may be related to a set of common cognitive factors among individuals who report having insomnia which cause them to be distressed with their sleep and increase their dissatisfaction with daytime functioning.

Narcoleptics with long sleep time had a similar disease course and similar frequencies of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations, multiple sleep onset in REM periods, short mean sleep latencies, and human leukocyte antigen DQB1*0602 positivity as narcoleptics with normal sleep time did. However, they had longer sleep time during 24 h, and higher sleep efficiency, lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores, and reported their naps were more often unrefreshing. Only 3/23 had core narcolepsy (human leukocyte antigen and cataplexy positive). The subgroup of narcoleptics with a long sleep time comprises 18% of narcoleptics. Their symptoms combine the disabilities of both narcolepsy (severe sleepiness) and idiopathic hypersomnia (long sleep time and unrefreshing naps).

We found elevated levels of gliosis with glial fibrillary acidic protein staining, with levels increased in the posterior hypothalamic nucleus by (295%), paraventricular (211%), periventricular (123%), arcuate (126%), and lateral (72%) hypothalamic nuclei, but not in the anterior, dorsomedial, or dorsal hypothalamus. There was no reduction in the number of melanin-concentrating hormone neurons in either patient. Narcolepsy without cataplexy can be caused by a partial loss of hypocretin cells.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Elevated anti-streptococcal antibodies in patients with recent narcolepsy onset.  Participants were tested for markers of immune response to beta hemolytic streptococcus (anti-streptolysin O [ASO]; anti DNAse B [ADB]) and Helicobacter pylori [Anti Hp IgG], two bacterial infections known to trigger autoimmunity. A general inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), was also studied. When compared to controls, ASO and ADB titers were highest close to narcolepsy onset, and decreased with disease duration. For example, ASO > or = 200 IU (ADB > or = 480 IU) were found in 51% (45%) of 67 patients within 3 years of onset, compared to 19% (17%) of 67 age matched controls (OR = 4.3 [OR = 4.1], P < 0.0005) or 20% (15%) of 69 patients with long-standing disease (OR = 4.0 [OR = 4.8], P < 0.0005]. CRP (mean values) and Anti Hp IgG (% positive) did not differ from controls. Streptococcal infections are probably a significant environmental trigger for narcolepsy.\n",

Boys were less likely to evidence anhedonia (OR = 0.67, P < .05), insomnia (OR = 0.68, P < .05), and hypersomnia (OR = 0.56, P < .05) but more likely to have psychomotor agitation (OR = 1.59, P < .01). There were no age-by-sex interactions. Rates of somatic complaints did not decrease with age (OR = 1.01, P > .05). The symptom presentation of major depressive disorder becomes somewhat more neurovegetative as children get older. However, girls display more affective and atypical symptoms across all age groups. Somatic complaints were common regardless of age and should be considered an associated feature of depression in children and adolescents.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea in narcolepsy.  Thirty-three patients (24.8%) had an apnea-hypopnea index greater than 10 with a mean index of 28.5+/-15.7. Ten of them were initially diagnosed only with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the diagnosis of narcolepsy was delayed 6.1+/-7.8years until being evaluated in our center for residual excessive daytime sleepiness after continuous positive airway pressure therapy. In the remaining 23 patients, narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea were diagnosed simultaneously. Cataplexy occurred with similar frequency in both groups. excessive daytime sleepiness did not improve in 11 of the 14 patients who were treated with continuous positive airway pressure. The presence of obstructive sleep apnea was associated with male gender, older age and higher body mass index. obstructive sleep apnea occurs frequently in narcolepsy and may delay the diagnosis of narcolepsy by several years and interfere with its proper management. In patients with obstructive sleep apnea, cataplexy should be actively looked for to exclude the presence of narcolepsy. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure does not usually improve excessive daytime sleepiness in narcoleptics with obstructive sleep apnea.\n",

Ubiquitinated inclusions were not observed in the total of 96 remaining hypocretin cells in these subjects. Further, we noted that even in patients with dementia neuropathology, the lateral hypothalamic hypocretin area was spared from ubiquitinated inclusions. AIF1 and GFAP staining in the perifornical area was unremarkable. Our findings suggest that hypocretin cell loss does not involve ubiquitinated inclusions, the hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. The lack of increased markers of inflammation also argues against a progressive and continuous neurodegenerative process.\n",

Although allergic rhinitis (allergic rhinitis) is accepted as a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome), the role of nonallergic rhinitis (Nallergic rhinitis) is unknown. The most frequent sleep symptom was snoring. Patients with allergic rhinitis had a significantly longer sleep duration and better sleep efficiency than did those with Nallergic rhinitis. Both groups had frequent arousals. obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was diagnosed in 36% of patients with allergic rhinitis and in 83% of those with Nallergic rhinitis (P = .001). Severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome existed only in the Nallergic rhinitis group. Nallergic rhinitis showed a high correlation with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (odds ratio, 6.4) and with apneas (odds ratio, 0.2). Body mass index, sex, and coexisting asthma did not have any predictable effect on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, but age was correlated with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The impairment in quality of life was similar in both groups. Both allergic rhinitis and Nallergic rhinitis are risk factors for a high apnea-hypopnea index, and both can predispose to sleep apnea. However, Nallergic rhinitis seems to have a greater risk according to impaired polysomnography results and higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores. Therefore, patients with rhinitis should be treated not only for nasal symptoms but also for a better quality of sleep.\n",

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) is a common disorder that remains underdiagnosed in adult females. The Berlin Questionnaire is a validated tool for identifying people at risk for Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The aim of this report was to evaluate the prevalence of common symptoms of Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in women and to estimate the risk for Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among females in the United States. Twenty-five percent of the female population was found to be at high risk for Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Among women at high risk, such common symptoms of Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome as habitual snoring (61%), observed apneas (7%), and daytime sleepiness (24%) were highly prevalent. Sleep onset insomnia (32%) or maintenance insomnia symptoms (19%) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) symptoms (33%) or body movements (60%) also were frequently reported. The risk increased with age (p < 0.05), obesity (p < 0.001), and menopause (p < 0.001). The presence of chronic medical disorders was more frequently reported among women at high risk. One in four women in America is at high risk of having Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Awareness by the primary care medical community of this disorder in females should thus be increased.\n",

      "Processing abstract: The nightly administration of sodium oxybate results in significant reduction in the nocturnal sleep disruption of patients with narcolepsy. Previous studies indicate that nightly sodium oxybate administration reduces nocturnal sleep disruption in narcolepsy. The present study provided an opportunity to further characterize these sleep-related effects in patients with narcolepsy during treatment with sodium oxybate as monotherapy or in combination with modafinil. After 8 weeks, significant changes in sleep architecture among patients receiving sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate/modafinil included a median increase in Stage 3 and 4 sleep (43.5 and 24.25 min, respectively) and delta power and a median decrease in nocturnal awakenings (6.0 and 9.5, respectively). No significant changes in PSG parameters were noted in patients treated with placebo or modafinil alone. In addition to its established efficacy for the treatment of cataplexy and EDS, nightly sodium oxybate administration significantly reduces measures of sleep disruption and significantly increases slow-wave sleep in patients with narcolepsy.\n",

Lower hit rate and higher post-drive Sleepiness Scale predicted greater numbers of driving errors in all subjects. Yet, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, predrive Sleepiness Scale, and most objective measures of disease severity failed to predict driving and vigilance performance in obstructive sleep apnea. Reduced vigilance for peripheral visual targets indicates that obstructive sleep apnea drivers have restriction of their effective field of view, which may partly explain their increased crash risk. This fatigue-related decline in attention is predicted by increased subjective sleepiness during driving. These findings may suggest a means of identifying and counseling high-risk drivers and aid in the development of in-vehicle alerting and warning devices.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Sleep problems, sleepiness and daytime behavior in preschool-age children. Sleep problems are a common complaint of parents of preschool children. Children with neurodevelopmental disorders have even more disrupted sleep than typically developing children. Although disrupted nighttime sleep has been reported to affect daytime behavior, the pathway from sleep disruption to sleep problems, to impairments in daytime performance or behavior is not clear. This multi-method, preliminary study assessed this path in 68 children with autism, matched to 57 children with developmental delay without autism and 69 children developing typically. Controlling for diagnosis and developmental age of the child, nighttime sleep problems determined by parent reports were significantly associated with decrements in daytime behavior, also measured by parent report instruments. However, actigraph-defined sleep problems and objective measures of daytime sleepiness were not associated with decrements in daytime performance. Parent report measures substantiate relationships between disrupted sleep patterns and waking behavior. Further understanding of the pathway from sleep disorders to daytime sleepiness and decrements in waking performance, however, may require more rigorous methods of assessment such as polysomnography and the multiple sleep latency test.\n",

When either obstructive sleep apnea or excessive daytime sleepiness were absent, the strength of the association with work disability was less than when both obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness were present. When obstructive sleep apnea was examined without respect to excessive daytime sleepiness, patients with obstructive sleep apnea were at increased risk of recent work disability relative to patients without obstructive sleep apnea (OR 2.6; 95% CI 1.2-5.8), but the association of obstructive sleep apnea with longer-term work duty modification did not meet standard criteria for statistical significance (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 0.8-5.0). The combination of obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness contributes to work disability, and obstructive sleep apnea by itself contributes to recent work disability. These findings should highlight to employers and clinicians the importance of obstructive sleep apnea in the workplace to encourage patients to be screened for obstructive sleep apnea, particularly in situations of decreased productivity associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",

Sudden, often positive emotions are typical triggers for cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy (narcolepsy-cataplexy). Cataplexy during sexual intercourse and orgasm (orgasmolepsy) has been previously reported, but its frequency and characteristics are poorly known. Orgasmolepsy was reported by three narcolepsy-cataplexy patients (two female, one male), one male patient with behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome) and cataplexy-like symptoms, and none of the healthy controls. In the two female narcolepsy-cataplexy patients, orgasmolepsy occurred by each sexual intercourse, and the male patient reported orgasmolepsy only when in a relationship involving emotional commitment and trust. In the patient with behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome and orgasmolepsy, cataplexy-like symptoms involved unilaterally upper or lower limbs in association with negative emotions or sports activities. Cataplexy during sexual intercourse is a distinct feature of narcolepsy-cataplexy, which can, however, be reported rarely also by patients with other sleep-wake disorders. Insufficient arousal may favor the occurrence of cataplexy and cataplexy-like symptoms, including orgasmolepsy.

Mean latency to NREM2 sleep was similar in narcolepsy-cataplexy (8.6+/-4.7) and behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (8.1+/-2.7, p=0.64); latency to either NREM2 or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (i.e., the sum of the sleep latency to non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 and the duration of the first non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 sleep sequence), however, was shorter in narcolepsy-cataplexy (4.4+/-2.9) than in behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (7.9+/-3.5, p<0.001). Referring to all naps with sleep onset REM periods, the sequence non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1-REM-NREM2 was more common (71%) in narcolepsy-cataplexy than in behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (15%, p<0.001), reflecting the shorter latency from non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 to NREM2 in behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome (3.7+/-2.5) than in narcolepsy-cataplexy (6.1+/-5.9, p<0.001). Our findings show that both sleepiness (as measured by non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 sleep latency) and REM sleep propensity are higher in narcolepsy-cataplexy than in behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome. Furthermore, our finding of frequent REM sleep prior to NREM2 sleep in narcolepsy-cataplexy is in line with the recent assumption of an insufficient NREM sleep intensity in narcolepsy-cataplexy. Together with detailed clinical interviews, sleep logs, actigraphy, and nocturnal polysomnography, mean sleep latencies to non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1 <or= 2.5 min, the presence of multiple sleep onset REM periods, and the sequence non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 1-REM-NREM2 may be the best multiple sleep latency test measures to discriminate narcolepsy-cataplexy from behaviourally induced insufficient sleep syndrome.\n",

The severity of the disease was judged by clinical complaints, Epworth Sleepiness Scale value and Multiple Sleep Latency Test results. No relations with the age at onset and clinical tetrad were found, however, smoking may be associated with an increased risk of hypnagogic hallucinations. There was no correlation between the number of sleep and cataplectic attacks and the age at onset, nor did subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale show any significant dependence. However, earlier onset of the disease correlated with shorter Multiple Sleep Latency Test mean latency. A correlation was found between the BMI and narcolepsy sleepiness rating in the elderly and between degree of education attained and subjective complaints.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sleep duration, wake/sleep symptoms, and academic performance among Hong Kong students. Fifty-nine students were recruited. The average sleep duration in this group was 7.23 h. The overall prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness (defined as an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of >10) was 25.4%. Eleven subjects had excessive class sleepiness, defined as high likelihood to fall asleep during at least one school session. Mathematics performance was positively correlated with sleep duration. Excessive sleepiness on rising was identified as a significant risk factor for poor performance in English and Mathematics. Sleepiness during the third and fourth lessons was identified as a significant risk factor for poor performance in Mathematics only. Sleep deprivation was common in the studied cohort and it was associated with a decrease in Mathematics performance.

Approximately 16% (n = 244) of the sample acknowledged a diagnosis of diabetes; they were older, had more comorbidities, had a higher body mass index (body mass index), and were more likely to be sleepy during the daytime than nondiabetic respondents (all P < .05). Respondents with diabetes who reported frequent daytime sleepiness (n = 50; 20%) had significantly (P < .05) higher body mass index, lower self-rated health, and more sleep disturbances than those who were not sleepy (n = 194). Sleepy respondents with diabetes also reported more frequent feelings of depression, decreased pleasure in life, naps, feeling drowsy, or dozing off while driving (all P < .05). Excessive sleepiness was significantly associated (P < .001) with an increased risk for depressive symptoms while controlling for body mass index, age, and number of comorbidities.

Older pupils and evening types showed a higher sleepiness. Daytime sleepiness was higher after the transition until the third week after. Older pupils and pupils scoring higher on eveningness reported higher daytime sleepiness after the transition, suggesting that these pupils suffer most from the change.

      "Processing abstract: Optimal treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness. Collapsibility of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) causes repeated arousals from sleep, decreased oxygen saturation of the blood, and excessive sleepiness (excessive sleepiness). Patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, and experience occupational and vehicular accidents more frequently than the general population. Furthermore, the life expectancy of patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea is significantly reduced. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the reference-standard treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. CPAP addresses the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and reduces the risk of heart disease and depression associated with this sleep disorder. However, the efficacy of CPAP is contingent on patient adherence, and >or=4 hours of therapy per night are required for patients with obstructive sleep apnea to experience significant clinical benefits. However, reports of nonadherence to CPAP therapy range from 29% to 83%. Other therapies are available for patients who refuse or cannot adhere to CPAP treatment, including dental devices and surgery, but these treatments are generally considered to be less efficacious. A significant number of patients continue to experience residual excessive sleepiness despite CPAP treatment. Pharmacologic therapies, eg, modafinil and armodafinil, may be of use in patients with obstructive sleep apnea to improve tolerance with CPAP or to address residual excessive sleepiness. There are a variety of treatments available for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Successful treatment involves encouraging patient compliance with CPAP or oral appliances. Primary-care physicians play a crucial role in recognizing this disorder and ensuring the best possible outcome through support and education.\n",

As of July 01, 2001, estimated prevalence per 100,000 of physician-diagnosed narcolepsy with cataplexy was 21.8 (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.8-24.8), similar to prior studies. The median age of onset was 14 (interquartile range: 10-18). For narcolepsy with HLA-DQB1 *0602, prevalence was 15.3 (95% CI: 12.8-17.9). Estimated prevalence was higher in women than men and in African-Americans than other racial groups. These differences could reflect problems in identification and recruitment or may provide etiologic clues about narcolepsy. This study illustrates the challenges in performing population-based studies of narcolepsy.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep in bipolar patients. Sleep disturbance has been described in bipolar disorder (bipolar disorder). Specific complaints may include frequent nighttime awakenings, poor quality of sleep, reduction in total sleep time, and nightmares. Most patients with bipolar disorder also report insomnia when in depression, but a significant percentage of patients report hypersomnia symptoms with prolonged nighttime sleep, difficulty in wakening, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep complaints have negative influence on general quality of life, observed by decreased scores in WHOQOL and Global Assessment of Functioning domains and increased Sheehan scores, indicating the importance of maintenance of normal sleep in bipolar patients. Our results suggest that sleep complains impair quality of life and global function. Collectively, further studies are warranted to investigate the impairment of sleep disturbance on others neurotrophic factors and neurochemical pathways.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Development of a Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (JEpworth Sleepiness Scale) based on item response theory. Various Japanese versions of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) have been used, but none was developed via standard procedures. Here we report on the construction and testing of the developer-authorized Japanese version of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (JEpworth Sleepiness Scale). We identified two of our proposed questions as appropriate replacements for two problematic questions in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The JEpworth Sleepiness Scale had very few missing data. Internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability were high. The patients had significantly higher JEpworth Sleepiness Scale scores than did the healthy people, and higher JEpworth Sleepiness Scale scores were associated with worse daytime function, as measured with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. In Japan, the JEpworth Sleepiness Scale provides reliable and valid information on daytime sleepiness. Researchers who use the Epworth Sleepiness Scale with other populations should combine their knowledge of local conditions with the results of psychometric tests.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Exacerbation of cataplexy following gradual withdrawal of antidepressants: manifestation of probable protracted rebound cataplexy. A double-blind, placebo-controlled sodium oxybate trial provided a unique opportunity to compare changes in cataplexy following gradual withdrawal from antidepressants in narcolepsy patients. Among the patients who were and were not withdrawn from antidepressants treatment, the median frequency of baseline weekly cataplexy was similar (17.5 vs. 14.0, respectively). As expected, significant between-group differences emerged by the end of the washout period (52.04 vs. 15.25, respectively; p<0.05); however, the frequency of cataplexy events became similar again by the end of the trial (16.5 vs. 17.5, respectively). Patients gradually withdrawn from antidepressants experienced a significant increase in cataplexy, but eventually returned to their baseline frequency, comparable to previously untreated control patients. Compared to SSRIs, discontinuation from TCAs was associated with a greater increase in cataplexy attacks.\n",

The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children) is a 26-item instrument for evaluating sleep among children aged 3-18 years. It differentiates among conditions such as disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, sleep breathing disorders, disorders of arousal, sleep-wake transition disorders, excessive somnolence, and sleep hyperhydrosis. The aim of this study was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate it for Brazilian Portuguese. The scale instructions and items were adapted regarding semantic, experiential, conceptual, and cultural equivalence validation. The scale structure related to visual communication was also adapted to Brazilian population preference and habits, and this resulted in a chart with clear instructions and easy recognition of the statements and possible responses. Reliability analysis showed values greater than 0.55. There has been reasonable convergent validity. Discriminatory validity using the PSG study for positive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) was 8.9, attesting discriminatory validity only for SDB. The three questions of the scale can screen SDB. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children was translated, adapted and validated for Brazilian Portuguese, and it presented internal consistency and convergent and discriminatory validity. It can be used in population-based studies in order to screen for sleep-disordered breathing in children.\n",

Hypersomnia is a common problem amongst individuals with Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Disorder). The objective of this meta-analysis is to estimate the frequency of hypersomnia in individuals with Bipolar Disorder, and identify associated factors METHODS: Our search focused on articles documenting the frequency of hypersomnia among individuals with Bipolar Disorder indexed in PubMed database and in the Cochrane Library, following the recommendations from the Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (Meta-Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) Group. A meta-analysis of proportion was conducted; funnel plot and Egger's test were used for the assessment of publication bias. Subgroups analyses were performed in order to evaluate possible confounders and associated factors. We identified 10 studies, which included 1824 patients with Bipolar Disorder. The overall estimate of the proportion of Bipolar Disorder cases that reported hypersomnia was 29.9% [95% confidence interval (confidence interval): 25.8 - 34.1%, I<sup>2</sup>=59.2%; p<.05]. The funnel plot and the Egger's test suggest a low risk of publication bias (p=.527). The polarity of mood state, Bipolar Disorder type, use of medication, age, diagnostic criteria and hypersomnia criteria were not significantly related to hypersomnia. There is a possibility that smaller cross-sectional studies were not included. The high heterogeneity between studies is frequent in meta-analysis of both interventional and observational studies. Hypersomnia was not the primary outcome in some of the included studies.\n",

      "Processing abstract: PER3 gene regulation of sleep-wake behavior as a function of latitude.  Latitude is associated with a differential expression of circadian and sleep profiles. We observed a shift toward eveningness with increased latitude and increased social jetlag and diurnal sleepiness at latitude 30degrees. Moreover, our results suggest that the PER3 variable number of tandem repeats polymorphism has a modulatory effect on these circadian and sleep profiles: the variant PER3<sup>4/4</sup> is associated with a smaller difference in the sleep duration on weekdays among different latitudes and is associated with longer sleep duration on weekends just at latitude 30degrees, even when compared to both other genotypes at the same latitude. On the other hand, irrespective of the genotype, volunteers from latitude 30degrees expressed increased social jetlag and diurnal sleepiness. The seasonal variation in the light/dark cycle, tied to latitude, together with the tight social time constraints that young adults are subjected to during weekdays, generates differences in the sleep phenotypes. Volunteers with the PER3<sup>4/4</sup> variant who live farther from the equator have a greater increase in their weekend sleep duration.\n",

Gamma aminobutyric acid (Gamma aminobutyric acid) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014 and 2016. We included five trials with 3838 participants (acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients, 3758 analyzed). Most of the participants recruited had acute ischaemic stroke, with limited data available from participants with other stroke subtypes, including total anterior circulation syndrome (total anterior circulation syndrome). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. For death and dependency at three months, pooled results did not find a significant difference for chlormethiazole versus placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11; four trials; 2909 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07; one trial; 849 participants; moderate-quality evidence). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; 2527 participants; moderate-quality evidence). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed randomized controlled trials with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup.

Somatic symptoms are prevalent in patients with major depressive disorder (major depressive disorder) and often associated with a high risk of suicide. However, which somatic symptoms display as significant risk factors for suicidal ideation (suicidal ideation) is still poorly understood in major depressive disorder. Our results showed a high prevalence of current suicidal ideation in first-episode major depressive disorder (50.87%), while no significant gender differences (53.32% vs. 49.26%, P=0.076) were observed. In addition, patients who have more somatic symptoms would be at the higher risk to elicit suicidal ideation, and stepwise logistic regression analysis indicated that age (beta=-0.020, P<0.001), Pre-verbal physical complaints (beta=0.356, P=0.001), Sensory system complaints (beta=0.707, P=0.000), Other pain conditions (beta=0.434, P<0.001), Late insomnia (beta=0.267, P=0.008), Hypersomnia (beta=0.936, P<0.001), Weight loss (beta=0.272, P=0.006), Hyposexuality (beta=0.513, P=P<0.001) were strongly associated with current suicidal ideation in first-episode Chinese major depression.

      "Processing abstract: Incidence rates of narcolepsy diagnoses in Taiwan, Canada, and Europe: The use of statistical simulation to evaluate methods for the rapid assessment of potential safety issues on a population level in the SOMNIA study.  Incidence rates of narcolepsy varied by age, continent, and period. Only in Taiwan and Sweden were significant time-period-by-age-group interactions observed. Associations were found for children in Taiwan (following pandemic H1N1 virus circulation) and Sweden (following vaccination). Simulations showed that the individual-level relative risk of narcolepsy was underestimated using ecological methods comparing post- vs. pre-vaccination periods; this effect was attenuated with higher vaccine coverage and a shorter interval from disease onset to diagnosis. Ecological methods can be useful for vaccine safety assessment but the results are influenced by diagnostic delay and vaccine coverage. Because ecological methods assess risk at the population level, these methods should be treated as signal-generating methods and drawing conclusions regarding individual-level risk should be avoided.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Olanzapine for the prevention and treatment of cancer-related nausea and vomiting in adults. Olanzapine as an antiemetic represents a new use of an antipsychotic drug. People with cancer may experience nausea and vomiting whilst receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or whilst in the palliative phase of illness. We included 14 randomised controlled trials (1917 participants) from high-, middle- and low-income countries, representing over 24 different cancers. Thirteen studies were in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Oral olanzapine was administered during highly emetogenic (HEC) or moderately emetogenic (MEC) chemotherapy (12 studies); chemoradiotherapy (one study); or palliation (one study). Eight studies await classification and 13 are ongoing.The main comparison was olanzapine versus placebo/no treatment. Other comparisons were olanzapine versus NK1 antagonist, prokinetic, 5-HT3 antagonist or dexamethasone.We assessed all but one study as having one or more domains that were at high risk of bias. Eight randomised controlled trials with fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, and 10 randomised controlled trials with issues related to blinding, were at high risk of bias. We downgraded GRADE assessments due to imprecision, inconsistency and study limitations.Olanzapine versus placebo/no treatmentPrimary outcomesOlanzapine probably doubles the likelihood of no nausea or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% (risk ratio (RR) 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.59 to 2.47; 561 participants; 3 studies; solid tumours; HEC or MEC therapy; moderate-quality evidence) when added to standard therapy. Number needed to treat for additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was 5 (95% CI 3.3 - 6.6).It is uncertain if olanzapine increases the risk of serious adverse events (absolute risk difference 0.7% more, 95% CI 0.2 to 5.2) (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.48 to 12.55; 7 studies, 889 participants, low-quality evidence).Secondary outcomesFour studies reported patient perception of treatment. One study (48 participants) reported no difference in patient preference. Four reported quality of life but data were insufficient for meta-analysis.Olanzapine may increase other adverse events (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.96; 332 participants; 4 studies; low-quality evidence) and probably increases somnolence and fatigue compared to no treatment or placebo (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.30 to 4.18; anticipated absolute risk 8.2% more, 95% CI 1.9 to 18.8; 464 participants; 5 studies; moderate-quality evidence). Olanzapine probably does not affect all-cause attrition (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.73; 943 participants; 8 studies; I(2) = 0%). We are uncertain if olanzapine increases attrition due to adverse events (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 70.16; 422 participants; 6 studies). No participants withdrew due to lack of efficacy.We are uncertain if olanzapine reduces breakthrough nausea and vomiting (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.47; 501 participants; 2 studies; I(2) = 54%) compared to placebo or no treatment. No studies reported 50% reduction in severity of nausea or vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics, or attrition.We are uncertain of olanzapine's efficacy in reducing acute nausea or vomiting. Olanzapine probably reduces delayed nausea (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.09; 585 participants; 3 studies) and vomiting (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.42; 702 participants; 5 studies).Subgroup analysis: 5 mg versus 10 mgPlanned subgroup analyses found that it is unclear if 5 mg is as effective an antiemetic as 10 mg. There is insufficient evidence to exclude the possibility that 5 mg may confer a lower risk of somnolence and fatigue than 10 mg.Other comparisonsOne study (20 participants) compared olanzapine versus NK1 antagonists. We observed no difference in any reported outcomes.One study (112 participants) compared olanzapine versus a prokinetic (metoclopramide), reporting that olanzapine may increase freedom from overall nausea (RR 2.95, 95% CI 1.73 to 5.02) and overall vomiting (RR 3.03, 95% CI 1.78 to 5.14).One study (62 participants) examined olanzapine versus 5-HT3 antagonists, reporting olanzapine may increase the likelihood of 50% or greater reduction in nausea or vomiting at 48 hours (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.97) and 24 hours (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.34).One study (229 participants) compared olanzapine versus dexamethasone, reporting that olanzapine may reduce overall nausea (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.18), overall vomiting (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.48), delayed nausea (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.08) and delayed vomiting (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.45). There is moderate-quality evidence that oral olanzapine probably increases the likelihood of not being nauseous or vomiting during chemotherapy from 25% to 50% in adults with solid tumours, in addition to standard therapy, compared to placebo or no treatment. There is uncertainty whether it increases serious adverse events. It may increase the likelihood of other adverse events, probably increasing somnolence and fatigue. There is uncertainty about relative benefits and harms of 5 mg versus 10 mg.We identified only randomised controlled trials describing oral administration. The findings of this review cannot be extrapolated to provide evidence about the efficacy and safety of any injectable form (intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous) of olanzapine.\n",

When patients were classified into mild, moderate, and severe OSA groups, snoring index had statistically significant improvements in all 3 groups, and apnea/hypopnea index had statistically significant decreases in the moderate and severe OSA groups. Although reductions in Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were found in all 3 groups, the most statistically significant improvement was noted only in the severe OSA group. OSA surgery can improve daytime sleepiness in nonobese patients with OSA, especially for patients with severe OSA.

Median gamma-hydroxybutyrate concentrations at 1 and 3h were 83.1mg/L (range 54-110) and 24.4mg/L (range 7.2-49.7), respectively. Compared to placebo, at 1h post gamma-hydroxybutyrate dosing, significant differences were seen for the life-threatening outcome collisions (p<0.001) and off-road accidents (p=0.018). Although driving was not faster, there was significantly more weaving and erratic driving with gamma-hydroxybutyrate as measured by speed deviation (p=0.002) and lane position deviation (p=0.004). No significant impairment regarding driving outcomes was found in the gamma-hydroxybutyrate group at 3 and 6h post dose. gamma-hydroxybutyrate in doses used to treat narcolepsy resulted in severe driving impairment at 1h post dosing.

Milnacipran is a dual reuptake inhibitor of noradrenaline and serotonin, with greater effect on noradrenaline than serotonin, in contrast to the related drugs venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine. Rapidly absorbed irrespective of food, milnacipran has a half-life of approximately 8hours, reaches steady state in 2days and is excreted renally. Milnacipran helps a minority of patients with fibromyalgia by reducing pain and fatigue. It is also an effective antidepressant with efficacy comparable to venlafaxine and duloxetine, and a side effect profile characteristic of serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. The dose range is 50-200mg, in divided doses. Milnacipran may be useful for patients with depression and pain, and endogenous depression characterised by anergia, psychomotor retardation and hypersomnia. Caution is necessary in the presence of heart disease, hypertension, renal impairment, epilepsy, glaucoma, bipolar disorder, and bleeding tendency. Milnacipran is likely to be a useful late antidepressant option in treatment-resistant patients, as well as those with chronic pain, anergia and hypersomnia.\n",

Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (obstructive sleep apnoea) often present with excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale). However, the relationship between excessive daytime sleepiness and obstructive sleep apnoea severity as measured by the apnoea-hypopnoea index (apnoea-hypopnoea index) remains inconsistent. We hypothesise that this may be due to the usage and equal weightage of apnoea and hypopnoea events used in determining apnoea-hypopnoea index and that apnoea and hypopnoea load as measured by their total durations may be a better metric to use. We sought to investigate if apnoea or hypopnoea load can display better correlation with Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Epworth Sleepiness Scale was correlated with age (r = -0.148, <i>P</i> <0.001), number of apnoeas (r = 0.096, <i>P</i> = 0.006), apnoea load (r = 0.102, <i>P</i> = 0.003), apnoea index (r = 0.075, <i>P</i> = 0.032), number of desaturations (r = 0.081, <i>P</i> = 0.020), minimum SpO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.071, <i>P</i> = 0.041), time SpO<sub>2</sub> <85% (r = 0.075, <i>P</i> = 0.031) and REM sleep duration (r = 0.099, <i>P</i> = 0.004). Linear regression analysis found age (<i>P</i> <0.001), apnoea load (<i>P</i> = 0.005), REM (<i>P</i> = 0.021) and stage 1 sleep duration (<i>P</i> = 0.042) as independent factors correlated to Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The apnoea load calculated using duration in apnoea correlate with Epworth Sleepiness Scale in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnoea by apnoea-hypopnoea index criteria compared to the mild category. apnoea-hypopnoea index does not correlate with Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Younger age, longer apnoea, stage 1 and REM sleep were independently related to higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale though the correlations were weak. Apnoea load should be taken into account when determining obstructive sleep apnoea severity.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Coexisting narcolepsy (with and without cataplexy) and multiple sclerosis : Six new cases and a literature review. There are increasing data suggesting the involvement of the immune system in narcolepsy. The co-occurrence of narcolepsy with other autoimmune disorders (including multiple sclerosis, MS) is rare. A total of 26 patients (pts), 6 in the survey and 20 in the literature were found. Two different types of association were identified: (1) Symptomatic type (5 pts): MS preceding the onset of narcolepsy, which was always without cataplexy (NwC); sleep onset REM episodes (SOREM) and hypocretin deficiency were observed in some, and lesions in the hypothalamus in all patients. (2) Coexisting type (18 pts): MS preceding or following the appearance of NC with SOREM, hypocretin deficiency but no lesions in the hypothalamus. A positive effect of steroids, immunoglobulins or natalizumab on narcolepsy symptoms was observed in four patients. Narcolepsy and MS are rarely associated. In addition to NwC secondary to hypothalamic demyelination, some patients present a coexistence of MS with NC without detectable hypothalamic lesions. The rarity of reports on this association probably reflects underrecognition. The elucidation of underlying genetic and immune mechanisms needs further studies.\n",

OSA-patients with persistent excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) despite CPAP treatment are challenging in daily clinical life. To rule out residual sleep-disordered breathing (sleep-disordered breathing), CPAP device-derived data are used in outpatient setting. In case of no pathological finding, a more intensive work-up with is necessary. 6-channel portable monitoring (6-channel portable monitoring) is frequently used to exclude residual sleep-disordered breathing. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Peripheral arterial tonometry), as embodied in the WatchPeripheral arterial tonometry device, represents an alternative technique for detecting sleep-disordered breathing based on changes in autonomic tone. We wanted to investigate whether Peripheral arterial tonometry might be a useful tool to improve diagnostic work-up in this specific patient group by better identifying residual sleep-disordered breathing due to insufficient CPAP-adjustment.\n",
      "DRKS00007705. Twelve out of 49 patients showed persistent excessive daytime sleepiness according to ESS (ESS>10 points). 6-channel portable monitoring showed a residually increased AHI under CPAP-treatment in 2 of those 12 subjects (positive predictive value, PPV=16.7%). Peripheral arterial tonometry-PM revealed 5 patients of those 12 with residual sleep-disordered breathing (PPV=41.7%). Peripheral arterial tonometry could detect significantly more residual sleep-disordered breathing under CPAP treatment than 6-channel portable monitoring. Diagnostic work-up of CPAP-treated OSA patients with persistent excessive daytime sleepiness might be optimized, as insufficient pressure level adjustments could be recognized more precisely in time, possibly preventing more resource-consuming procedures, and potentially increased morbidity.\n",

Sleepiness at the wheel and driving while engaged in other activities are well known risk factors for traffic accidents. This article estimates the prevalence of these factors among Italian Professional Drivers (Professional Drivers) and their impact on reported driving mistakes. 161 (32.4%) subjects were defined as HiRis_Professional Drivers. Forty-one percent of the interviewees experienced at least one episode per month of sudden-onset sleep at the wheel. Twenty-eight point two percent reported a regular use of a hand-held cell phone. Predictive factors for being HiRis_Professional Drivers were: at least one self-reported episode per month of falling asleep at the wheel [odds ratio (OR) 5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.21-7.80, P<0.001], driving while regularly engaged in other activities (mainly hand-held cell phone use) (OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.90-12.84, P<0.001), and young age (OR 0.96, OR 1 year of age increase, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P=0.001).

      "Processing abstract: Modafinil Reduces Parasympathetic Activity but Does Not Influence Autonomic Reactivity to Orthostatic Load in Narcolepsy Type 1. Modafinil may affect autonomic functions in healthy subjects. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term modafinil administration influence on the cardiac autonomic reactivity to orthostatic load in patients with narcolepsy type 1. The sympathovagal reactivity to orthostatic load was not modified by modafinil treatment; nevertheless, the parasympathetic activity expressed by length of R-R interval and high-frequency component of HRV is reduced in supine position in patients taking modafinil. We conclude that long-term use of modafinil does not influence the cardiac autonomic reactivity to orthostatic load expressed by the HRV changes in supine-standing-supine test in narcolepsy type 1 patients, but the parasympathetic cardiac activity may be reduced in quiet supine position in patients with narcolepsy taking modafinil.\n",

Sleep disturbances are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease). Experimental studies suggest involvement of the serotonergic system in the regulation of sleep and arousal. Using [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB positron emission tomography, a marker of serotonin transporter availability, we investigated whether sleep dysfunction is associated with serotonergic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB BP<sub>ND</sub> was reduced by 32-49% in Parkinson's disease patients with sleep dysfunction, and 14-25% in Parkinson's disease without sleep dysfunction, compared to healthy controls. Parkinson's disease patients with sleep dysfunction had lower [<sup>11</sup>C]DASB BP<sub>ND</sub> in caudate (<i>P</i><0.01), putamen (<i>P</i><0.001), ventral striatum (<i>P</i><0.001), thalamus (<i>P</i><0.05), hypothalamus (<i>P</i><0.001) and raphe nuclei (<i>P</i><0.01), compared to Parkinson's disease without sleep dysfunction.

Our findings demonstrate that sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced serotonergic function in the midbrain raphe, basal ganglia and hypothalamus. Strategies to increase serotonin levels in the brain could be a promising approach to treat sleep dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, and may also have relevance in other neurodegenerative disorders.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Patterns of depressive symptom remission during the treatment of seasonal affective disorder with cognitive-behavioral therapy or light therapy. To elucidate mechanisms related to remission in winter seasonal affective disorder (seasonal affective disorder), we explored the course of individual depressive symptom offset across two distinct treatment modalities that show comparable outcomes at treatment endpoint: cognitive-behavioral therapy for seasonal affective disorder (CBT-seasonal affective disorder) and light therapy (light therapy). For most (13/17; 76%) symptoms, CBT-seasonal affective disorder and light therapy did not differ in time to remission. However, for four symptoms (early insomnia, psychic anxiety, hypersomnia, and social withdrawal), light therapy led to symptom remission more quickly than CBT-seasonal affective disorder. Symptom remission progressed comparably across CBT-seasonal affective disorder and light therapy for most symptoms. Despite the fact that the two treatments led to similar remission rates and improvements at treatment endpoint, for early insomnia, psychic anxiety, hypersomnia, and social withdrawal, light therapy led to symptom remission faster than CBT-seasonal affective disorder. These results suggest different mechanisms and pathways to the same therapeutic end. Speedier remission of early insomnia and hypersomnia is consistent with the theory that seasonal affective disorder is related to a pathological circadian phase-shift that can be corrected with light therapy.\n",

      "Processing abstract: An overview of hypocretin based therapy in narcolepsy. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is most commonly caused by a loss of hypocretin/orexin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus (i.e., Narcolepsy Type 1). Since hypocretin deficiency is assumed to be the main cause of narcoleptic symptoms, hypocretin replacement will be the most essential treatment for narcolepsy. Unfortunately, this option is still not available clinically. There are many potential approaches to replace hypocretin in the brain for narcolepsy such as intranasal administration of hypocretin peptides, developing small molecule hypocretin receptor agonists, hypocretin neuronal transplantation, transforming hypocretin stem cells into hypothalamic neurons, and hypocretin gene therapy. Together with these options, immunotherapy treatments to prevent hypocretin neuronal death should also be developed.  Among hypocretin replacement strategies, developing non-peptide hypocretin receptor agonists is currently the most encouraging since systemic administration of a newly synthesized, selective hypocretin receptor 2 agonist (YNT-185) has been shown to ameliorate symptoms of narcolepsy in murine models. If this option is effective in humans, hypocretin cell transplants or gene therapy technology may become realistic in the future.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Sleep deficiency and motor vehicle crash risk in the general population: a prospective cohort study. Insufficient sleep duration and obstructive sleep apnea, two common causes of sleep deficiency in adults, can result in excessive sleepiness, a well-recognized cause of motor vehicle crashes, although their contribution to crash risk in the general population remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of sleep apnea, sleep duration, and excessive sleepiness to crash risk in a community-dwelling population. Among 3201 evaluable participants, 222 (6.9%) reported at least one motor vehicle crash during the prior year. A higher apnea-hypopnea index (p < 0.01), fewer hours of sleep (p = 0.04), and self-reported excessive sleepiness (p < 0.01) were each significantly associated with crash risk. Severe sleep apnea was associated with a 123% increased crash risk, compared to no sleep apnea. Sleeping 6 hours per night was associated with a 33% increased crash risk, compared to sleeping 7 or 8 hours per night. These associations were present even in those who did not report excessive sleepiness. The population-attributable fraction of motor vehicle crashes was 10% due to sleep apnea and 9% due to sleep duration less than 7 hours. Sleep deficiency due to either sleep apnea or insufficient sleep duration is strongly associated with motor vehicle crashes in the general population, independent of self-reported excessive sleepiness.\n",

Narcolepsy type 1 (Narcolepsy type 1) is a chronic neurologic disorder defined by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, hallucinations and disrupted nocturnal sleep, typically with onset during childhood/ adolescence. Pediatric Narcolepsy type 1 is associated with limitations on children's activities and achievements, especially poor performance at school, difficulty with peers due to disease symptoms and comorbidities including depression, obesity, and precocious puberty. Sodium oxybate (Sodium oxybate) is a sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyric (gamma-hydroxybutyric) acid and is greatly effective in treating cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in Narcolepsy type 1 and it can be helpful also for sleep disruption, hypnagogic hallucination and sleep paralysis in these patients. We reported sixteen papers focusing on symptom presentation and on clinical and metabolic features of children affected with Narcolepsy type 1. Furthermore, we reported 24 manuscripts focusing on Sodium oxybate biological actions and pharmacological properties and on the few but important available studies (8) conducted in Narcolepsy type 1 children under Sodium oxybate therapy. Although in the majority of patients develop Narcolepsy type 1 during childhood, there are no approved treatments for pediatric Narcolepsy type 1. However, Sodium oxybate has been widely used off-label to treat narcolepsy symptoms in children and adolescents with Narcolepsy type 1 in non-controlled studies, showing a similar safety profile and therapeutic response to adult patients. Ongoing pediatric therapy is based only on observational data shared among sleep disorders clinicians.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prostaglandin D2 Receptor DP1 Antibodies Predict Vaccine-induced and Spontaneous Narcolepsy Type 1: Large-scale Study of Antibody Profiling. Neuropathological findings support an autoimmune etiology as an underlying factor for loss of orexin-producing neurons in spontaneous narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy; sNT1) as well as in Pandemrix influenza vaccine-induced narcolepsy type 1 (Pandemrix influenza vaccine-induced narcolepsy type 1). The precise molecular target or antigens for the immune response have, however, remained elusive. Our data showed that although the immunoprofiles toward vaccination were generally similar in study groups, there were also striking differences in immunoprofiles between sNT1 and Pandemrix influenza vaccine-induced narcolepsy type 1 groups as compared with controls. Prominent immune response was observed to a peptide epitope derived from prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1), as well as peptides homologous to B cell lymphoma 6 protein. Further validation confirmed that these can act as true antigenic targets in discriminating NT1 diseased along with a novel epitope of hemagglutinin of H1N1 to delineate exposure to H1N1. We propose that DP1 is a novel molecular target of autoimmune response and presents a potential diagnostic biomarker for NT1. DP1 is involved in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and thus alterations in its functions could contribute to the disturbed sleep regulation in NT1 that warrants further studies. Together our results also show that MVA is a helpful method for finding novel peptide antigens to classify human autoimmune diseases, possibly facilitating the design of better therapies.\n",

Facial involvement is present in both partial and generalized cataplexy. Conversely, generalized pseudocataplexy is associated with persistence of deep tendon reflexes during the attack. Self-reported features confirmed the important role of positive emotions (laughter, telling a joke) in triggering the attacks, as well as the more frequent occurrence of partial body involvement in cataplexy compared with pseudocataplexy.

The total sleep time cutoff best discriminating clear-cut idiopathic hypersomnia and controls was 19 hours for the 32-hour recording (sensitivity = 91.9%, specificity = 85.7%) and 12 hours (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24 hours. The 19-hour cutoff displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between idiopathic hypersomnia and non-idiopathic hypersomnia patients. Patients with idiopathic hypersomnia above the 19-hour cutoff were overweight, had more sleep inertia, and had higher total sleep time on all periods compared to patients below 19 hours, whereas no differences were found for the 12-hour cutoff. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and total sleep time during 32-hour recording in idiopathic hypersomnia patients. In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cutoff best discriminating patients from controls was 19 hours over 32 hours, allowing a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on the multiple sleep latency test were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. Ann Neurol 2018;83:235-247.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Recognizable clinical subtypes of obstructive sleep apnea across international sleep centers: a cluster analysis.  The original obstructive sleep apnea clusters of disturbed sleep, minimally symptomatic, and excessively sleepy replicated among 215 Sleep Apnea Global Interdisciplinary Consortium patients from Iceland. These clusters also generalized to 757 patients from five other countries. The three clusters had similar average AHI values in both Iceland and the international samples, suggesting clusters are not driven by obstructive sleep apnea severity; differences in age, gender, and body mass index were also generally small. Within the international sample, the three original clusters were expanded to five optimal clusters: three were similar to those in Iceland (labeled disturbed sleep, minimal symptoms, and upper airway symptoms with sleepiness) and two were new, less symptomatic clusters (labeled upper airway symptoms dominant and sleepiness dominant). The five clusters showed differences in demographics and AHI, although all were middle-aged (44.6-54.5 years), obese (30.6-35.9 kg/m2), and had severe obstructive sleep apnea (42.0-51.4 events per hour) on average. Results confirm and extend previously identified clinical clusters in obstructive sleep apnea. These clusters provide an opportunity for a more personalized approach to the management of obstructive sleep apnea.\n",

Among 60 adults evaluated (57% female, aged 25 +/- 10 years, body mass index: 39 +/- 12 kg/m2), 67% reported excessive sleepiness. According to the sleep study results, 43% had a previously unrecognized hypersomnia disorder, 15% had an isolated sleep breathing disorder, 12% had combined hypersomnia disorder and untreated breathing sleep disorder, and only 30% had normal sleep. Isolated hypersomnia disorder included narcolepsy in 35% (type 1, n = 1, and type 2, n = 8), hypersomnia in 12% (total sleep time >11 hours, n = 2, and MSLT <8 minutes, n = 1), and borderline phenotype in 53% (>=2 sleep onset in REM periods and MSLT >8 minutes, n = 10, and 8 minutes < MSLT < 10 minutes, n = 4). Sleep breathing disorders, isolated and combined, included obstructive sleep apnea (n = 14, already treated in seven), sleep hypoxemia (n = 1) and previously undiagnosed hypoventilation (n = 5). Modafinil was taken by 16 patients (well tolerated in 10), resulting in improved sleepiness over a mean 5-year follow-up period. Sleepiness affects more than half of adult patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, with a variety of hypersomnia disorder (narcolepsy, hypersomnia, and borderline phenotypes) and breathing sleep disorders.

      "Processing abstract: Treatment guidelines for Circadian Rhythm Sleep - Wake Disorders of the Polish Sleep Research Society and the Section of Biological Psychiatry of the Polish Psychiatric Association. Part II. Diagnosis and treatment.  Patients with endogenous Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are often misdiagnosed and treated for insomnia or hypersomnia. Therefore, each patient reporting sleep-wake disorders should be interviewed about the quality of sleep and its timing during free days (e.g. weekends, holidays). Avalid Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders diagnosis can be also established by using sleep diaries/logs and actigraphy. The treatment of choice for Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders is chronotherapy, which involves melatonin application, light therapy, and behavioral interventions. Sleep disorders associated with shift work and time zone changes are a growing health problem. Interventions for these disorders should primarily focus on prevention. The main problem in the treatment of Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders is an invalid diagnosis. Hypnotics and/or psychostimulants are often used instead of chronotherapeutic interventions, what can alleviate symptoms but is not an effective treatment.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Anesthetic Management of Narcolepsy Patients During Surgery: A Systematic Review. Narcolepsy is a rare sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep paralysis, and/or hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, and in some cases cataplexy. The response to anesthetic medications and possible interactions in narcolepsy patients is unclear in the perioperative period. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the current evidence on the perioperative outcomes and anesthetic considerations in narcolepsy patients. A total of 19 studies including 16 case reports and 3 case series were included and evaluated. The majority of these patients received general anesthesia, whereas a small percentage of patients received regional anesthesia. Reported complications of narcolepsy patients undergoing surgeries were mainly related to autonomic dysregulation, or worsening of narcolepsy symptoms intra/postoperatively. Narcolepsy symptoms worsened only in those patient populations where the preoperative medications were either discontinued or reduced (mainly in obstetric patients). In narcolepsy patients, use of depth of anesthesia monitoring and total intravenous technique may have some advantage in terms of safety profile. Several patients undergoing neurosurgery involving the hypothalamus or third or four ventricles developed new-onset narcolepsy. We found a paucity of prospective clinical trials in this patient population, as most of the studies were case reports or observational studies. Continuation of preoperative medications, depth of anesthesia monitoring, use of multimodal analgesia with short-acting agents and regional anesthesia techniques were associated with favorable outcomes. Obstetric patients may be at greater risk for worsening narcolepsy symptoms, possibly related to a reduction or discontinuation of medications. For neurosurgical procedures involving the hypothalamus or third and fourth ventricle, postoperative considerations should include monitoring for symptoms of narcolepsy. Future studies are needed to better define perioperative risks associated with anesthesia and surgery in this population of patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Update on treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia. Idiopathic hypersomnia (Idiopathic hypersomnia) is a poorly characterized orphan central disorder of hypersomnolence responsible for excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness), prolonged nighttime sleep and sleep inertia that often require long-term symptomatic stimulant medication. To date, no drug has currently the authorization for the treatment of Idiopathic hypersomnia patients worldwide. Areas covered: The authors reviewed data on pharmacological treatment of Idiopathic hypersomnia obtained from published literature (Medline/PubMed/Web of Science) and Clinicaltrial.gov database from 1997 to 2017. Most of data on treatment of Idiopathic hypersomnia derived from observational studies and case series with only three well-designed clinical trials available. Expert opinion: In two recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, modafinil improves excessive daytime sleepiness in Idiopathic hypersomnia. Most of other wakefulness-promoting agents labeled for narcolepsy have similar efficacy in cases series of Idiopathic hypersomnia patients. Pitolisant and sodium oxybate show promising results in two retrospective studies. The efficacy of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor antagonists on objective excessive daytime sleepiness needs to be clarified. All these medications are used off-label for the management of excessive daytime sleepiness in Idiopathic hypersomnia. Specific clinical instruments and objective tests are required in Idiopathic hypersomnia to better evaluate the severity of excessive daytime sleepiness and responsiveness to medications, but also prolonged sleep and sleep inertia, to optimize the whole management of Idiopathic hypersomnia patients.  \n",

A similar pattern was observed for changes in shifts from rapid eye movement to Stage N1/Wake and from Stage N1/Wake to rapid eye movement. Relative to placebo, sleep quality significantly improved with sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate+modafinil (p<=0.05) but not with modafinil alone. These results show that sodium oxybate with and without modafinil significantly consolidated sleep and improved patient-reported sleep quality relative to placebo. In contrast, no such effects were observed with modafinil alone, suggesting a specific effect of sodium oxybate on disrupted nighttime sleep in addition to its effect on daytime sleepiness.

In univariable analysis, cf-PWV was strongly related to systolic BP parameters and age, but also to antihypertensive drugs (p=0.030), metabolic syndrome (p=0.025) and daytime sleepiness (p=0.004). Sleepy patients had a more severe Obstructive sleep apnea, with AHI 44.8 (19.0) vs 29.7 (15.7) events/h (p=0.018), but sleep study parameters were not associated with cf-PWV values. On multivariable regression, a significant interaction between time (continuous positive airway pressure) and sleepiness (p=0.033) was found. There was a weak evidence of a cf-PWV reduction after continuous positive airway pressure treatment (p=0.086), but the effects of treatment differed significantly between groups, with no changes in non-sleepy patients, while in sleepy patients a significant decrease was observed (p=0.012). Evaluating non-sleepy patients group under continuous positive airway pressure therapy, results showed that both higher pulse pressure (p=0.001) and lower LDL-cholesterol levels (p=0.015) at baseline were associated to higher cf-PWV changes. Patients with daytime sleepiness had a more severe Obstructive sleep apnea and presented a greater arterial stiffness improvement after continuous positive airway pressure therapy, independently from age and BP. Besides sleepiness, cf-PWV reduction after continuous positive airway pressure therapy was mainly associated to CV risk factors, and less to sleep study parameters.\n",

At the first polysomnography-multiple sleep latency test, patients with noncataplectic central disorders of hypersomnolence were classified as having NT2 (22.7%), idiopathic hypersomnia (26.7%), or UnsEDS (50.6%). A positive polysomnography-multiple sleep latency test was confirmed in 72.7% of narcolepsy type 1. The classification consistency at retesting was significantly lower for the NT2 (47.1%), idiopathic hypersomnia (25.0%), and UnsEDS (42.1%) categories than narcolepsy type 1 (81.3%). The between-test mean sleep latency (mean sleep latency) variability was significantly different in narcolepsy type 1 and noncataplectic central disorders of hypersomnolence, with higher changes in NT2 and lower in narcolepsy type 1. A longer test-retest interval was associated with improved mean sleep latency and mean sleep latencyT normalization. Between-test variations in SOREMP number were associated with changes in nocturnal REM sleep parameters and mean sleep latency.

      "Processing abstract: Correlation between the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test in patients with narcolepsy participating in two clinical trials of sodium oxybate. In evaluating pathologic sleepiness, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) assesses subjective sleep propensity; the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (Maintenance of Wakefulness Test) is an objective measure of the ability to stay awake. This analysis evaluated the strength of the correlation between Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test with regard to absolute values in scores. Overall, correlations across all treatment groups in each study described an inverse relationship, reflecting the scoring of each measure (ie, whereas higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores indicate greater sleepiness, higher Maintenance of Wakefulness Test scores indicate a greater ability to remain awake). Significant correlations of low-to-moderate strength were observed at all time points in both studies. In SXB-15, correlation coefficients were-0.272,-0.365, and-0.343 at baseline (n=221), week four (n=212), and week eight (n=205), respectively, with all P<0.0001.

Although all correlations showed statistical significance, they were of low-to-moderate strength. These results indicate that Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Maintenance of Wakefulness Test measure features of pathologic sleepiness that may be distinct, but partially overlapping.

Patients with narcolepsy showed a dislocation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in state space and overlap of REM and WAKE behavioral states. Narcolepsy patients had more trajectories between the REM and the WAKE clusters and also between the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and WAKE clusters. Point density analysis showed more transitional periods between WAKE and REM in narcolepsy, less consolidated NREM sleep, and higher velocities between WAKE and NREM in patients. Conventional sleep analysis revealed increased NREM1 and decreased NREM2 sleep and reduced REM latency in narcolepsy patients. This study provides further evidence for narcolepsy as a disorder of state boundaries including but not limited to REM sleep and wakefulness. In particular, the increase in transitional periods between REM and WAKE but also between NREM and WAKE indicates abnormal state dynamics in narcolepsy.

Mean results for the cohort are ESS 13.7, mean sleep latency 11.5min, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-A 8.2, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-D 7. There was no significant correlation between objective sleepiness, as measured by the mean sleep latency, and either Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-A (-0.006, p=0.93) or Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-D score (0.002, p=0.98). There was, however, a weak correlation between subjective sleepiness, as measured by the ESS, and the mean sleep latency (-0.25, p<0.01), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-A (0.15, p=0.03), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-D (0.2, p= 0.004). There was no significant association between diagnosis of hypersomnia disorders and presence of anxiety (p= 0.71) or depression (p=0.83). Mood disorders are highly prevalent in the mean sleep latency test population. There was a weak correlation found between subjective measures of sleepiness and mood disorders, but not between objective measures of sleepiness and mood disorders. Routine screening for mood disorders in patients with hypersomnolence should be considered.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Autoimmunity in narcolepsy.  Both genetic and epidemiological evidence point towards an autoimmune mechanism in the destruction of orexin/hypocretin neurons. Recent studies suggest both humoral and cellular immune responses in the disease development. Narcolepsy is a severe sleep disorder, in which neurons producing orexin/hypocretin in the hypothalamus are destroyed. The core symptoms of narcolepsy are debilitating, extreme sleepiness, cataplexy, and abnormalities in the structure of sleep. Both genetic and epidemiological evidence point towards an autoimmune mechanism in the destruction of orexin/hypocretin neurons. Importantly, the highest environmental risk is seen with influenza-A infection and immunization. However, how the cells are destroyed is currently unknown. In this review we summarize the disease symptoms, and focus on the immunological findings in narcolepsy. We also discuss the environmental and genetic risk factors as well as propose a model for disease development.\n",

Two hundred sixty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 23% (60 of 262) had polysomnogram-confirmed obstructive sleep apnea (group II). This rate was much higher than that found in the general population. Of the patients, 7% (19 of 262) were known to have obstructive sleep apnea at initial surgical consultation (Group II was further subdivided into patients referred with polysomnogram (PSG)-confirmed OSA). An additional 16% (41 of 262) were later confirmed by polysomnogram to have obstructive sleep apnea (group IIb). Patients with primary mandibular deficiency and short face dentofacial deformitys were most likely to have obstructive sleep apnea (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively).In group II, 91% (55 of 60) rated their daytime sleepiness as \"not sleepy\" at a minimum of 1year after surgery. A significant association was found between group II patients with postoperative excessive daytime sleepiness (\"sleepy\" or \"very sleepy\") and a preoperative body mass index category of overweight (P=.026). Our study found silent obstructive sleep apnea to be frequent in the dentofacial deformity population. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in dentofacial deformity patients exceeded that estimated in the general population, with retrusive jaw patterns most affected. In dentofacial deformity patients also presenting with obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive nasal breathing, we confirmed low levels of daytime sleepiness long-term after simultaneous bimaxillary orthognathic, chin, and intranasal surgery.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Pedestrian safety in patients with Parkinson's disease: A case-control study. Patients with Parkinson's disease experience debilitating motor symptoms as well as nonmotor symptoms, such as cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders. This constellation of symptoms has the potential to negatively influence pedestrian safety. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of motor symptoms, daytime sleepiness, impaired vigilance, and cognitive dysfunction with pedestrian behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy older adults. The virtual reality pedestrian environment was feasible in all participants. Patients with Parkinson's disease demonstrated riskier pedestrian behavior compared with controls. Among Parkinson's disease participants, walking speed, objective measures of vigilance, and visual processing speed were correlated with pedestrian behavior, with walking speed the strongest predictor of time to contact, explaining 48% of the variance. Vigilance explained an additional 8% of the variance. In controls, vigilance was also important for street-crossing safety, but older age was the most robust predictor of pedestrian safety. Walking speed is associated with unsafe pedestrian behavior in patients with Parkinson's disease. In contrast, age was the strongest predictor of pedestrian safety in healthy older adults.

Most of participants with major depressive episode (92%) reported significant sleep complaints, from whom 85.2% had insomnia and 47.5% hypersomnia symptoms. The prevalence rates were for insomnia \"only\" of 48.5%, hypersomnia \"only\" of 13.7%, and their co-occurrence of 30.2%. We found that several sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education, individual and familial income, marital status) and psychiatric disorders (bipolar disorders, post-traumatic disorders and panic disorder) were significantly and independently associated with different sleep profiles. The co-occurrence of insomnia (especially early wake-up) and hypersomnia presented with a two-/three- fold increase risk of bipolar disorders.

      "Processing abstract: Altered Regional Cerebral Blood Flow in Idiopathic Hypersomnia.  Participants with idiopathic hypersomnia showed regional cerebral blood flow decreases in medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex and putamen, as well as increases in amygdala and temporo-occipital cortices. Lower regional cerebral blood flow in the medial prefrontal cortex was associated with higher daytime sleepiness. These preliminary findings suggest that idiopathic hypersomnia is characterized by functional alterations in brain areas involved in the modulation of vigilance states, which may contribute to the daytime symptoms of this condition. The distribution of regional cerebral blood flow changes was reminiscent of the patterns associated with normal non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, suggesting the possible presence of incomplete sleep-wake transitions. These abnormalities were strikingly distinct from those induced by acute sleep deprivation, suggesting that the patterns seen here might reflect a trait associated with idiopathic hypersomnia rather than a non-specific state of sleepiness.\n",

Complete datasets were obtained from 384 patients with Parkinson's disease who were either past or present driving license holders. Fifty-seven patients had caused at least one motor vehicle accidents in the last 5years before the survey. Logistic regression analyses revealed that ergot-dopamine agonist (dopamine agonist) use and excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >= 10) were the best predictors of motor vehicle accidentss. Patients having caused non-sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss had significantly longer disease durations, more frequent ergot-dopamine agonist use, and higher cognition and communication subscores on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 than those without non-sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss (P<.05). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores of Parkinson's disease patients with sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss were significantly higher than those of patients without sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss (P<.01). Excessive daytime sleepiness and ergot-dopamine agonist use may be important predictive risk factors for motor vehicle accidentss in Parkinson's disease. Daytime sleepiness appears to be related to sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss in Parkinson's disease, whereas disease progression and ergot-dopamine agonist use may contribute to non-sleep-related motor vehicle accidentss.\n",

Based on test results of WatchPAT200 and polysomnography, the diagnosis of severe sleep apnea was established and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) treatment was introduced. Severe Obstructive sleep apnea led in this patient to almost total absence of REM sleep, a significant reduction of deep sleep as well as the reduction of total sleep time. The presence of daytime sleepiness, unremitting despite the modification of treatment, indicates the need for diagnostic screening for Obstructive sleep apnea, which can mimic some of the symptoms of depression, increase the risk of complications during anesthesia, and can be one of the causes of drug resistance. In addition to the negative impact of obstructive sleep apnea on the course of bipolar disorder, Obstructive sleep apnea also causes significant cognitive impairment in terms of attention and vigilance, long-term semantic and visual memory as well as visual-spatial and executive functions.\n",

The overall aim is to identify factors important for the life-situation of children and adolescents with narcolepsy and their families, and factors that correlate with trust in healthcare.  This project will use the situation of young persons with narcolepsy after the swine flu vaccination as a case to build a model that can be used in situations where trust in healthcare is essential. This model will be based on findings from the included studies on how trust is influenced by support, quality of life, burden of disease, impact on family, and use of social media.

The patients (63 girls, 70 boys) slept for an average of 7h 30min and 8h 44min on weekdays and weekends, respectively. The mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 11.01+/-4.09 and did not differ significantly among sleep disorders. Among the 102 patients who completed the depression questionnaire, 53 showed depressive feelings, which were moderate or severe in 39, with no significant differences among specific sleep disorders. Thirty-four patients exhibited normal polysomnography results. Seventeen of them were concluded as not having any sleep disorders, and the others as having delayed sleep phase disorder (delayed sleep phase disorder). Narcolepsy (n=78) was the most common disorder, followed by delayed sleep phase disorder (n=17) and idiopathic hypersomnia (n=12). Pediatric patients with excessive daytime sleepiness had various sleep disorders and some did not have any sleep disorder despite excessive daytime sleepiness.

Neurologic disorders are often associated with abnormalities of sleep. Sleep influences the severity of both epilepsy and headache, and treatment of comorbid sleep disorders may improve seizure and headache frequency. Alzheimer disease is characterized by circadian phase delay and poor nighttime sleep and is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Parkinson disease is associated with several sleep disorders, including insomnia, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, daytime hypersomnia, and sleep-disordered breathing.

      "Processing abstract: Narcolepsy and Other Central Hypersomnias.  In ICSD-3, the names of some central disorders of hypersomnolence have been changed: narcolepsy with cataplexy and narcolepsy without cataplexy have been renamed narcolepsy type 1 and narcolepsy type 2, respectively. A low level of hypocretin-1/orexin-A in the CSF is now theoretically sufficient to diagnose narcolepsy type 1, as it is a highly specific and sensitive biomarker. Conversely, other central hypersomnias are less well-defined disorders with variability in the phenotype, and few reliable biomarkers have been discovered so far. The epidemiologic observation that influenza A (H1N1) infection and vaccination are potential triggering factors of narcolepsy type 1 (discovered during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic) has increased interest in this rare disease, and progress is being made to better understand the process (highly suspected to be autoimmune) responsible for the destruction of hypocretin neurons. Treatment of narcolepsy remains largely symptomatic, usually initially with modafinil or armodafinil or with higher-potency stimulants such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. Several newer wake-promoting agents and psychostimulants have also been developed, including sodium oxybate, which has a role in the treatment of cataplexy and as an adjunctive wake-promoting agent, and pitolisant, a selective histamine H3 receptor inverse agonist that is currently only available in Europe. Although far less common than many other sleep disorders, central hypersomnias are among the most severe and disabling diseases in the field of sleep medicine, and their early recognition is of major importance for patients, especially children, to maximize their quality of life and functioning in activities of daily living.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Diagnostic Approach and Investigation in Sleep Medicine.  Home sleep apnea testing in appropriate situations can replace laboratory polysomnography in many cases of uncomplicated sleep apnea. Multiple sleep latency tests must be performed meticulously and interpreted in the clinical setting to avoid overdiagnoses of narcolepsy. Human leukocyte antigen testing has limited utility in establishing a diagnosis of narcolepsy because a positive test has low specificity. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is frequently the first manifestation of an evolving synucleinopathy, and a careful history and neurologic examination are needed to determine other early features of these disorders. A meticulous history from the patient, supplemented by collateral history from an observer, is essential to establishing the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Judicious supplementary use of investigations, such as laboratory polysomnography, home sleep apnea testing, wrist actigraphy, and multiple sleep latency tests, can confirm the correct diagnosis. This article describes an approach to the sleepy patient, the patient with neuromuscular disease and possible sleep-disordered breathing, the patient with restless legs syndrome, and young and older patients with abnormal movements during sleep.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Brain Circuitry Controlling Sleep and Wakefulness.  Discrete but interconnected clusters of cells located within the brainstem and hypothalamus comprise the circuits that generate wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, and REM sleep. These clusters of cells use specific neurotransmitters, or collections of neurotransmitters, to inhibit or excite their respective sleep- and wake-promoting target sites. These excitatory and inhibitory connections modulate not only the presence of wakefulness or sleep, but also the levels of arousal within those states, including the depth of sleep, degree of vigilance, and motor activity. Dysfunction or degeneration of wake- and sleep-promoting circuits is associated with narcolepsy, REM sleep behavior disorder, and age-related sleep disturbances. Research has made significant headway in identifying the brain circuits that control wakefulness, non-REM, and REM sleep and has led to a deeper understanding of common sleep disorders and disturbances.\n",

Attentional complaints are common in narcolepsy patients and can overlap with daytime sleepiness features. Few studies attempted to characterize attentional domains in narcolepsy leading to controversial results. We aimed to assess the impact of hypocretin deficiency on attentional functioning by comparing performances on the attention network test (attention network test) of narcoleptic patients with hypocretin deficiency (narcolepsy type 1-NT1) versus patients without hypocretin deficiency (narcolepsy type 2-NT2) and healthy controls. We also addressed frequency and severity of psychopathological symptoms and their influence on performances on attention network test. NT1 and NT2 patients presented with slower reaction times compared to controls. NT1 patients exhibited an impairment of alerting network relative to NT2 and healthy controls, while orienting and executive control networks efficiency were comparable between groups. NT1 and NT2 displayed higher severity of ADHD inattentive domain than controls, NT1 patients also displayed higher severity of ADHD hyperactive domain and depressive symptoms. In NT1, ADHD and depressive symptoms were positively correlated. Despite a shared slowing of reaction times in both NT1 and NT2, a selective impairment of alerting network was present only in hypocretin deficient patients. Clinicians should carefully consider attentional deficits and psychopathological symptoms, including ADHD symptoms, in the clinical assessment and management of patients with narcolepsy.\n",

While non-pharmacological treatments are sometimes helpful, more than 90% of narcoleptic patients require a pharmacological treatment. Areas covered: The present review is based on an extensive Internet and PubMed search from 1994 to 2017. It is focused on drugs currently in development for the treatment of narcolepsy. Expert opinion: Currently there is no cure for narcolepsy, with treatment focusing on symptoms control. However, these symptomatic treatments are often unsatisfactory. The research is leading to a better understanding of narcolepsy and its symptoms. New classes of compounds with possible applications in the development of novel stimulant/anticataplectic medications are described. H3 receptor antagonists represent a new therapeutic option for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. JZP-110, with its distinct mechanism of action, would be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness in the coming years. In the future, hypocretin-based therapies and immune-based therapies, could modify the clinical course of the disease. However, more information would be necessary to completely understand the autoimmune process and also how this process can be altered for therapeutic benefits.  \n",

Starting from the initial item data-bank, a 17-item questionnaire, the Maugeri Sleep Quality and Distress Inventory (MaSQuDI-17), was produced. Parallel Analysis on the MaSQuDI-17 confirmed the presence of a single dimension; exploratory factor analysis showed salient loading for each item, explaining 58.7% of total variance. Item-remainder correlation ranged from 0.72 to 0.39 and Cronbach alpha was 0.896. Rasch analysis revealed satisfactory psychometric properties of the new scale: the rating structure performed according to expectations, model fit was good and no item dependencies emerged. The scale presented good convergent validity and scores significantly distinguished healthy subjects from OSAS or Insomnia or BSD (p < 0.001). MaSQuDI -17 shows good psychometric qualities, and can be used to assess the impact of sleep disorders such as Insomnia, OSAS, Central Hypersomnia and BSD on emotional stress.\n",

The cost-effectiveness measure was demonstrated to be particularly sensitive to the duration of the relative quality-of-life improvements accruing to patients treated with sodium oxybate. The estimated cost per additional QALY for the sodium oxybate treatment alternative compared with standard treatment was estimated above the informal Swedish willingness-to-pay threshold (SEK 500,000). The estimated cost per additional QALY obtained here is likely to overestimate the true cost-effectiveness ratio as potentially beneficial effects on productivity of treatment with sodium oxybate were not included (due to lack of data).\n",
      "Processing abstract: The development of a health-related quality-of-life instrument for young people with narcolepsy: NARQoL-21. Narcolepsy is a lifelong sleep disorder with a prevalence of between 0.03% and 0.06% and onset at around puberty. It is associated with psychiatric comorbidities and cognitive difficulties. No valid and reliable condition-specific health-related quality-of-life (health-related quality-of-life) instrument has been developed for this population. One hundred young people with narcolepsy and 95 control subjects returned questionnaires. The factor structure revealed two main factors with five domains and 21 questions, which was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis. The domains of the NARQoL-21 showed good independence while the floor and ceiling effects were acceptable. The external reliability (0.928), convergent validity (rs=0.769) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.886) were excellent. A Bland-Altman plot revealed some proportional bias. Good discriminant validity was detected for control/patient (Cohen's d=2.114). ROC analysis showed significantly better AUC for NARQoL-21 (0.939) than KIDSCREEN (0.877). A cut-off score equivalent to KIDSCREEN-10 for suboptimal health-related quality-of-life which maximized sensitivity (84%) and specificity (92%) was found at NARQoL-21 score below 42. Establishing the validity of a disease-specific health-related quality-of-life instrument in a population of people with a rare condition poses significant challenges. The mixed-methods approach adopted here has resulted in a questionnaire of 21 items with good discrimination and convergent validity, and excellent internal and external reliability, allowing precise and stable measurements. The cut-off score can be useful to identify patients with very poor health-related quality-of-life and thus improve the design of treatment options. Further testing in a longitudinal cohort is recommended in order to establish responsiveness.\n",

Self-reported daytime sleep duration was associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin levels (p=0.02and p=0.01, respectively) even after adjustment for age, body mass index, physical activity and social class. Compared with those with no daytime sleep, men with daytime sleep >1hour, defined as excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness), had a higher risk of raised N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide of >=400pg/mL, the diagnostic threshold for HF (OR (95%CI)=1.88 (1.15 to 3.1)), higher mean troponin, reduced lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s) and elevated von Willebrand factor, a marker of endothelial dysfunction. However, excessive daytime sleepiness was unrelated to CIMT and arterial stiffness. By contrast, night-time sleep was only associated with HbA1c (short or long sleep) and arterial stiffness (short sleep). Daytime sleep duration of >1hour may be an early indicator of HF.\n",

Levels were 2-4 times higher four hours after the first sodium oxybate dose (10.44-23.58 muM) and 3-5 times higher four hours after the second dose (ie, eight hours after first dose; 14.60-34.01 muM). GHB levels returned to endogenous levels 6-10h following the second dose, however variability was observed between patients and pregnancies. Higher breast milk GHB levels were observed with higher doses for both patients. Sodium oxybate is transmitted to breast milk. Despite its short half-life, GHB concentrations remained two-to-five times higher than endogenous levels four hours after both nighttime doses. To avoid excess GHB exposure, breastfeeding mothers who take sodium oxybate should consider expressing and discarding their morning milk. Future work should examine milk GHB levels after chronic sodium oxybate and determine whether levels change as milk composition changes across the postpartum period.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Safety and efficacy of long-term use of sodium oxybate for narcolepsy with cataplexy in routine clinical practice. Sodium oxybate is licensed in Europe for the treatment of narcolepsy with cataplexy in adults. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of sodium oxybate in clinical practice in patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy refractory to other treatments. 90 patients were prescribed sodium oxybate, with a total of 3116 patient-months of drug exposure. ESS and weekly cataplexy events were significantly reduced by sodium oxybate for all patients (DeltaESS=4.3+/-4.4 and Deltacataplexy=21.8+/-18.5 events/week; p<0.0001, respectively). The required maintenance dose could not be predicted based upon gender, body mass index, or clinical factors. 60% of patients were able to reduce or come off other medications. Half of the patients experienced at least one SE, and 26.6% had to stop treatment due to limiting SEs. Nausea, mood swings and enuresis were the most commonly reported SEs. SEs that led to drug discontinuation, particularly psychosis, were associated with increasing age and were observed early after the initiation of the drug. Sodium oxybate provides a good clinical efficacy and acceptable safety profile in routine clinical practice for the treatment of patients suffering from narcolepsy with cataplexy. A quarter of patients experience SEs requiring withdrawal of the drug with older patients being more vulnerable to the more serious SEs.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Sodium oxybate treatment in narcolepsy and its effect on muscle tone.  SMI and LMI decreased significantly during light sleep. LMI remained stable in all sodium oxybate groups during slow wave sleep (SWS), but decreased significantly during REM sleep. SMI decreased non-significantly, but consistently during SWS and REM in the 9g group only. A subgroup analysis of patients who stayed on stimulants showed that they had higher SMIs and LMIs in all groups. Patients who had been treated with anticataplectic medication prior to study inclusion had lower LMIs in the 9g group during REM sleep in all visits. sodium oxybate has a differential effect on muscle tone that is dose and sleep stage dependent. Low dosages increase short muscle activity, possibly enabling the occurrence of parasomnias. High doses are especially efficacious in REM sleep, suggesting that sodium oxybate could be used to treat REM sleep behavior disorder. Comedication with stimulants and prior medication with anticataplectic medication exerts an influence on muscle tone.\n",

The severity of depressive symptoms and the percentage of offspring with severe depressive symptoms, especially atypical depressive features, were significantly higher in the depressed offspring of bipolar disorder parents compared to the depressed controls (P<sub>s</sub> <.05). The depressive symptoms were helpful to identify a high-risk group (e.g., odds ratio [OR] for hypersomnia: 22.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-404, P=.04). In addition, there were significantly more depressed offspring of bipolar disorder parents with subsyndromal manic symptoms than controls (52.5% vs 20%, OR: 4.2, 95% CI: 1.2-14.7, P<.01).

Fatigue is common among patients with sarcoidosis. The etiology of this problem is unknown and multifactorial. Fatigue can be confounded with excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness). Fatigue and sleepiness have rarely been studied simultaneously in sarcoidosis patients. 16.5% (123 patients) had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale >=16), 16.4% had severe fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale >=35), and 6.3% had both extreme findings. In a multivariate logistic regression model, predictors of the risk of excessive daytime sleepiness were a history of sleep apnea (odds ratio [OR] 2.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.9), dyspnea Medical Research Council grade >=2 (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.5-3.5), and organ involvement of 4-7 organs (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.1-2.4). Significantly associated with higher risk of severe fatigue were the following: conspicuous depression (OR 5.95, 95% CI 4.1-8.7), conspicuous anxiety (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.6-3.4), and muscle pain (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.32-2.75). The logit models for severe fatigue with and without simultaneous excessive daytime sleepiness differed only slightly. An extreme form of fatigue and/or sleepiness was found in 27% of all sarcoidosis patients questioned. Because there is a certain overlap, both should be examined simultaneously to allow for a combined assessment.\n",

Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) is common and disabling in Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease). Predictors of Excessive daytime sleepiness are unclear, and data on biological correlates of Excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease are limited. We investigated clinical, imaging and biological variables associated with longitudinal changes in sleepiness in early Parkinson's disease. ESS increased in Parkinson's disease from baseline to year 3 (mean+/-SD 5.8+/-3.5 to 7.55+/-4.6, p<0.0001), with no change in HC. Longitudinally, Excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease was associated with non-tremor dominant phenotype, autonomic dysfunction, depression, anxiety and probable behaviour disorder, but not cognitive dysfunction or motor severity. Dopaminergic therapy was associated with Excessive daytime sleepiness at years 2 and 3, as dose increased. Excessive daytime sleepiness was also associated with presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction, whereas biofluid markers at year 1 showed no significant associations with Excessive daytime sleepiness. A predictive index for Excessive daytime sleepiness was generated, which included seven baseline characteristics, including non-motor symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated-tau/total-tau ratio. In early Parkinson's disease, Excessive daytime sleepiness increases significantly over time and is associated with several clinical variables. The influence of dopaminergic therapy on Excessive daytime sleepiness is dose dependent. Further longitudinal analyses will better characterise associations with imaging and biomarkers.\n",

However, the sleep microstructure has not yet been evaluated in these patients. We aimed to evaluate whether the sleep spindle (sleep spindle) density is altered in patients with narcolepsy type 1 compared to controls and patients with narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy type 2). Between-group comparisons in sleep stages revealed no significant differences in any type of sleep spindle. Within-group analyses of the sleep spindle trends revealed significant decreasing trends for narcolepsy type 1, HC, and C between first and last sleep cycle. Between-group analyses of sleep spindle trends between first and last sleep cycle revealed that narcolepsy type 2 differ from narcolepsy type 1 patients in the unspecified sleep spindle density in Nrapid-eye-movement sleep, and from HC in the slow sleep spindle density in N2 sleep. sleep spindle activity is preserved in narcolepsy type 1, suggesting that the ascending neurons to thalamic activation of sleep spindle are not significantly affected by the hypocretinergic system. narcolepsy type 2 patients show an abnormal pattern of sleep spindle distribution.\n",

Although we spend practically one third of our lifetimes in this stage, its importance is often taken for granted. Sleep loss can lead to disease, error and economic loss. Our understanding of how sleep is achieved has greatly advanced in recent years, and with that, the management of sleep disorders has improved. There is still room for improvement and recently many new compounds have reached clinical trials with a few being approved for commercial use. Areas covered: In this review, the authors make the case of sleep disorders as a matter of public health. The mechanisms of sleep transition are discussed emphasizing the wake and sleep promoting interaction of different brain regions. Finally, advances in pharmacotherapy are examined in the context of chronic insomnia and narcolepsy. Expert opinion: The orexinergic system is an example of a breakthrough in sleep medicine that has catalyzed drug development. Nevertheless, sleep is a topic still with many unanswered questions. That being said, the melanin-concentrating hormone system is becoming increasingly relevant and we speculate it will be the next target of sleep medication.  \n",

There was no difference between home and hospital assessment of mean sleep latency (P = 0.86). Two or more sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods were found more frequently on modified multiple sleep latency tests performed at home compared with those at the hospital (7 and 2, respectively; P = 0.025). Agreement was moderate for categorized sleep latency (kappa = 0.53) and fair for categorized sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (kappa = 0.39) in the 2 settings. Analysis of mean sleep latency using intraclass correlation coefficient showed a very good agreement between the two settings. Group mean sleep latency for home modified multiple sleep latency tests seems to be reliable compared with that for the attended sleep-laboratory setting. Higher rate of SOREMP in the unattended home suggests that napping in a familiar environment facilitates the transition into REM sleep. Further studies are needed to assess the normal limit, sensitivity, and specificity for SOREMP at home before the clinical utility of home-based napping can be determined.\n",

To further characterize sleep disorders associated with narcolepsy, we assessed the sleep-wake patterns, rapid eye movement (rapid eye movement), and non-rapid eye movement (Nrapid eye movement) sleep cycles in Chinese teenagers with narcolepsy. Compared with the controls, the narcoleptic patients showed a 1.5-fold increase in total sleep time over 24h, characterized by enhanced slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. Frequent sleep-wake transitions were identified in nocturnal sleep with all sleep stages switching to wakefulness, with more awakenings and time spent in wakefulness after sleep onset. Despite eight cases of narcolepsy with sleep onset rapid eye movement periods at night, the mean duration of Nrapid eye movement-rapid eye movement sleep cycle episode and the ratio of rapid eye movement/Nrapid eye movement sleep between patients and controls were not significantly different. Our study identified hypersomnia in teenage narcolepsy despite excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep fragmentation extended to all sleep stages, indicating impaired sleep-wake cycles and instability of sleep stages. The limited effects on Nrapid eye movement-rapid eye movement sleep cycles suggest the relative conservation of ultradian regulation of sleep.\n",

Pain and increased sleep need (in terms of hours per day or napping frequency) were found to co-exist in as much as 29% of mild traumatic brain injury patients at one month postinjury. Pain could be associated with more pronounced sleep need in about one-third of mild traumatic brain injury patients during early recovery.

Analyses revealed the following: older age (46-65 years, >=66 years) was negatively associated with drowsy driving (p<0.05, p<0.05), and habitually shorter sleep duration on weekdays (<=6 hours) was positively associated with drowsy driving (p<0.01). Habitual sleep duration of <=6 hours (p<0.01) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of >=11 (p<0.01) were positively associated with sleepiness-related vehicular accidents and near-miss events. However, AHI was not associated with these driving problems. Insufficient sleep, rather than severity of Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, was associated with sleepiness-related driving problems in these Japanese Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients.\n",

The final study group included 9312 subjects with narcolepsy and 46,559 controls (each group: average age, 46.1 years; 59% female). As compared with controls, patients with narcolepsy showed a statistically significant excess prevalence in all the Classification System multilevel categories, the only exceptions being conditions originating in the perinatal period and pregnancy/childbirth complications. The greatest excess prevalence in the narcolepsy cohort was seen for mental illness (31.1% excess prevalence; odds ratio (odds ratio) 3.8, 95% confidence interval (confidence interval) 3.6, 4.0), followed by diseases of the digestive system (21.4% excess prevalence; odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 2.5, 2.8) and nervous system/sense organs (excluding narcolepsy; 20.7% excess prevalence; odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 3.4, 3.9). In this claims analysis, a narcolepsy diagnosis was associated with a wide range of comorbid medical illness claims, at significantly higher rates than matched controls.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Armodafinil Therapy for Hypersomnia Associated with Dementia with Lewy Bodies: A Pilot Study.  Of 20 participants, 17 completed the protocol. The median age was 72 years, most of the participants were men (80%), and most had spouses as caregivers. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (p < 0.001), Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (p = 0.003), and Clinical Global Impression of Change (p < 0.001) scores improved at week 12. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory total score (p = 0.003), visual hallucinations (p = 0.003), and agitation (p = 0.02) improved at week 4. Caregiver overall quality of life improved at week 12 (p = 0.004). No adverse events occurred. These pilot data suggest improvements in hypersomnia and wakefulness and reasonable safety and tolerability of armodafinil therapy in hypersomnolent patients with dementia with Lewy bodies. Our findings inform the use of pharmacologic strategies for managing hypersomnolence in these patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Pharmacological management of narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Narcolepsy is an orphan neurological disease and presents with sleep-wake, motoric, neuropsychiatric and metabolic symptoms. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is most commonly caused by an immune-mediated process including genetic and environmental factors, resulting in the selective loss of hypocretin-producing neurons. Narcolepsy has a major impact on workableness and quality of life. Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the temporal available treatment options for narcolepsy (type 1 and 2) in adults, including authorization status by regulatory agencies. First- and second-line options are discussed as well as combination therapies. In addition, treatment options for frequent coexisting co-morbidities and different phenotypes of narcolepsy are presented. Finally, this review considers potential future management strategies. Non-pharmacological approaches are important in the management of narcolepsy but will not be covered in this review. Expert opinion: Concise evaluation of symptoms and type of narcolepsy, coexisting co-morbidities and patients' distinct needs is mandatory in order to identify a suitable, individual pharmacological treatment. First-line options include Modafinil/Armodafinil (for excessive daytime sleepiness, EDS), Sodium Oxybate (for EDS and/with cataplexy), Pitolisant (for EDS and cataplexy) and Venlafaxine (for cataplexy (off-label) and co-morbid depression). New symptomatic and causal treatment most probably will be completed by hypocretin-replacement and immune-modifying strategies.  \n",

      "Processing abstract: Perioperative risks of narcolepsy in patients undergoing general anesthesia: A case-control study.  The perioperative courses of 76 narcoleptic patients and their controls were examined. Compared to controls, narcoleptic patients were more often prescribed central nervous system stimulants (73.7% vs 4.0%, P<0.001) and antidepressants (46.1% vs 27.6%, P=0.007) and more often had obstructive sleep apnea (40.8% vs 19.1%, P<0.001). The intraoperative course was similar. The number of episodes of respiratory depression was not different between patients and controls (5 [6.6%] vs 12 [7.9%], respectively; P=0.80). Narcoleptic patients had a higher frequency of emergency response team activations (5 of 76 [6.6%]; 95% CI, 2.2%-14.7%) compared to controls (2 of 152 [1.3%]; 95% CI, 0.2%-4.7%) (P=0.04). Hemodynamic instability was the indication for all emergency response team activations except 1, which was for a narcoleptic patient who had excessive postoperative sedation and respiratory depression. Narcoleptic patients had similar intraoperative courses as the matched controls, including phase I anesthetic recovery. However, they had a higher rate of emergency response team activations than the controls, which suggests that patients with narcolepsy may be at increased perioperative risk.\n",

Topical brimonidine, 0.33%, gel can result in systemic central nervous system toxic effects when used as a hemostatic agent. At present, it is not possible to define a quantity with which brimonidine can be used safely, nor can a safe wound size be defined.

The prevalence of undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) during preoperative evaluation and the best method to screen obstructive sleep apnea and its association with postoperative complications remain unclear. 70/182 (38.5%) obtained a new diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, including 11/182 (6%) with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index >=15/h). On logistic regression analyses, the presence of obstructive sleep apnea was independently associated with postoperative oxygen desaturation (OR 5.96, 95% CI 2.35-15.1, p < 0.01), a postoperative complication within 7 days (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.77-7.45, p < 0.01) and within 30 days (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.74-7.1, p < 0.01). The STOP-BANG questionnaire did not identify 12/70 (17%) of the patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and classified 28% of the cohort as obstructive sleep apnea when the level III sleep study was negative. Unrecognized obstructive sleep apnea is common in preoperative patients and is independently associated with postoperative complications. The STOP-BANG questionnaire had a lower performance in the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in a South Indian population than the level III sleep study.\n",

      "Processing abstract: A nationwide, cross-sectional survey on unusual sleep postures and sleep-disordered breathing-related symptoms in people with Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome (Down syndrome) often have sleep-disordered breathing (sleep-disordered breathing). Unusual sleep postures, such as leaning forward and sitting, are observed in people with Down syndrome. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of unusual sleep postures and their relationships with sleep-disordered breathing-related symptoms (sleep-disordered breathing-RSs), such as snoring, witnessed apnoea, nocturnal awakening and excessive daytime sleepiness. Unusual sleep postures were recorded in 483 (42.0%) people with Down syndrome. These participants were significantly younger and had a history of low muscle tone more frequently than people without unusual sleep postures. In all ages, the leaning forward posture was more frequent than sitting. People with Down syndrome with unusual sleep postures suffered from sleep-disordered breathing-RSs. Those who slept in the sitting posture had more frequent sleep-disordered breathing-RSs than did those who slept with the leaning forward posture. Snoring, witnessed apnoea and nocturnal awakening were observed in 73.6, 27.2 and 58.2% of participants, respectively. Snoring increased with aging. Witnessed apnoea was more common in males and in those with hypothyroidism than in females and in those without hypothyroidism. Our study shows that there is a close relationship between unusual sleep postures and sleep-disordered breathing-RSs. We recommend that all people with Down syndrome with unusual sleep postures should be checked for the presence of sleep-disordered breathing.\n",

One-third of patients had undergone brain magnetic resonance imaging, with focal neurologic signs or symptoms being the most common indication for neuroimaging. Although seven patients had an identifiable finding on neuroimaging (e.g., chronic microvascular ischemic changes), clinical management was changed as a result of imaging in only three cases. In all three, the imaging finding was predated by clear clinical abnormalities. Neuroimaging may be a complementary part of an idiopathic hypersomnia evaluation, but the decision to pursue imaging should be made on a case-by-case basis.\n",

Higher Epworth sleepiness scale scores were highly significantly related to reduced quality of life in neuromuscular-specific (r=0.77, p<0.001) and generic measures (r=0.78, p<0.001). excessive daytime sleepiness was not significantly related to intellectual function or sleep disorders as detected on polysomnography. excessive daytime sleepiness is common in children and adolescents with DM1.

The factor analysis revealed five factors: difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep (DIMS), sleep breathing disorders (SBD), disorders of excessive somnolence (DOES), parasomnias (PARA) and non-restorative sleep (NRS). This psychometric structure is reliable and logical in comparison with the experts' diagnoses. Convergent validity, divergent and internal reliability are very good. Inter-parental concordance in scoring the child's sleep problem does show differences in the ways in which parents report their children's sleep patterns. Cut-off was calculated for the total score (45). This study validated a 25-item French version of the questionnaire. The French Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children could therefore be used to aid screening of sleep disorders in the general population.\n",

Participants with possible attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder were more likely than non-attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder participants to have an evening chronotype and experience depressive symptoms, sleepiness, and sleep disturbances. The rates of having moderate and severe sleepiness in the possible attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder group were higher than those in the non-attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder group. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses revealed that the presence of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms was independently associated with excessive daytime sleepiness even after adjusting for factors related to the presence of sleepiness. When examining inattention and hyperactivity scores among participants with possible attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the inattention score was significantly higher in the severe excessive daytime sleepiness group compared with the moderate and non-excessive daytime sleepiness groups. excessive daytime sleepiness was relatively common in adults with possible attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, especially inattentiveness, were associated with the formation of excessive daytime sleepiness in this population.\n",

Twenty-two cases and 44 controls were included in the analyses. Mean age was 62.6+/-15 years, 72% were male. Median duration of medication use was 27 months (range 1-98). There were four deaths among cases versus eight among controls. Four cases had a pacemaker and six had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator inserted, compared to six and eight respectively in the control group. Age (p=0.01) and positive airway pressure (positive airway pressure) compliance (p=0.01), but not stimulant medication use (p=1.00) were associated with mortality on univariate analysis. In multiple logistic regression analyses accounting for body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index/respiratory disturbance index, positive airway pressure compliance, ejection fraction and duration of follow up, use of stimulant medication was not associated with mortality (p=0.50), pacemaker (p=0.20) or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (p=0.90) implantation.

      "Processing abstract: Underutilization of the MSLT in sleepy patients with a short onset REM period (short onset REM period) in the sleep clinic.  The vast majority of patients (n=347/391; 89%) with a PSG short onset REM period never received MSLT testing. Patients that were evaluated by MSLT (n=44; 11%) were typically very sleepy and 82% ended up with a diagnosis of narcolepsy or had MSLTs consistent with current narcolepsy criteria (ie, including the nocturnal short onset REM period). Only seven of the 140 patients (n = 5%) that with OSA that first underwent one or more PAP titrations were subsequently seen for an MSLT. Compared to those that eventually received an MSLT, patients that did not receive MSLT testing were older (52 vs. 41 years, p<0.001), more likely to have moderate to severe OSA (AHI>=15; 39% vs. 16%, p<0.001), and were generally less likely to report severe sleepiness (ESS>=16; 25% vs. 55%, p<0.001) and vehicle or workplace accidents or injuries. However, 12% of those that never received an MSLT reported such extreme sleepiness that they endorsed a near-miss car accident due to sleepiness, almost twice as prevalent than that found in a random sample of matched moderate-to-severe OSA patients (p<0.01). Overall, the reliability of the short onset REM period phenotype was low at 9.8%, but was much higher for those diagnosed with type 2 narcolepsy (31%) compared to those without narcolepsy (IH or normal MSLTs; 0%; p<0.01) or where narcolepsy status was unknown because an MSLT was not conducted (7%; p<0.01). The MSLT has been historically underutilized for those exhibiting a short onset REM period on diagnostic PSG, a potential marker of narcolepsy. This is presumably because patients with a PSG short onset REM period reported variable levels of sleepiness (although some severe) and many had some degree of OSA, which may either be a partial factor in symptomology or even obscure true narcolepsy. Some patients with a PSG short onset REM period were very sleepy and most, when an MSLT was conducted, received a diagnosis of type 2 narcolepsy despite few presenting with some of the associated features of narcolepsy. Well-controlled longitudinal studies with high quality data on cataplexy and hypocretin status are needed to understand where the PSG short onset REM period phenomenon falls on the hypersomnolence spectrum and to establish which comorbidities share variance with and/or potentially mask narcolepsy. However because untreated narcolepsy can have high social, functional, and financial burden, until such studies are done, physicians should consider a narcolepsy workup when a short onset REM period is observed (especially if multiple are seen) as well as close follow-up for symptom resolution when, for example, a patient is treated for sleep apnea.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Assessing sleepiness and cataplexy in children and adolescents with narcolepsy: a review of current patient-reported measures.  All self-reported cataplexy questionnaires from among 27 citations were study-specific diaries and were not identifiable as a recognized validated questionnaire. For excessive daytime sleepiness, 118 of 401 abstracts were further reviewed and the names of 21 questionnaires identified, of which eight questionnaires did not return additional citations of their validation. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) or a modified version was the most frequently used measure of excessive daytime sleepiness. Although all measures were associated with limitations for use in the pediatric population, the ESS has been successfully used in adolescents and was deemed readily amenable to further modification for children. There remains a dearth of validated measures for assessing excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in children and adolescents with narcolepsy. The need for these measures may be filled by modification or adaptation of existing adult measures; a daily cataplexy diary and the ESS may be readily modified to make them child-friendly with regard to wording and settings, but should still undergo psychometric validation.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Nocturnal Dynamics of Sleep-Wake Transitions in Patients With Narcolepsy. We investigate how characteristics of sleep-wake dynamics in humans are modified by narcolepsy, a clinical condition that is supposed to destabilize sleep-wake regulation. Subjects with and without cataplexy are considered separately. Differences in sleep scoring habits as a possible confounder have been examined. We find that wake duration distributions are consistent with power laws for healthy subjects (China: alpha = 0.88, Europe: alpha = 1.02). Wake durations in all groups of narcolepsy patients, however, follow the exponential law (tau = 6.2-8.1 min). All sleep duration distributions are best fitted by exponentials on long time scales (tau = 34-82 min). We conclude that narcolepsy mainly alters the control of wake-episode durations but not sleep-episode durations, irrespective of cataplexy. Observed distributions of shortest wake and sleep durations suggest that differences in scoring habits regarding the scoring of short-term sleep stages may notably influence the fitting parameters but do not affect the main conclusion.\n",

Only 3 (5%) of 61 patients showed a score >=1, one with immunoglobulin G1- and two with immunoglobulin G3-antibodies, but titers were low (1:40-1:100). CSFs from these patients were negative. The three positive patients included one narcolepsy type 1 case with associated psychotic features, one narcolepsy type 2 patient, and an narcolepsy type 1 patient with normal hypocretin CSF levels. Low levels of immunoglobulin G1 or immunoglobulin G3 antibodies against HCRTR2 were found in 3 of 61 patients with narcolepsy, although only 1 presented with full-blown narcolepsy type 1. HCRTR2-Abs are not common in narcolepsy unrelated to vaccination.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Objective, but Not Subjective, Sleepiness is Associated With Inflammation in Sleep Apnea.  The agreement between objective and subjective excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea patients was fair (kappa = 0.22). Objective excessive daytime sleepiness (lower Multiple Sleep Latency Test) in obstructive sleep apnea patients was associated with significantly elevated 24-hour (beta = -0.34, p = .01), daytime (beta = -0.30, p = .02) and nighttime (beta = -0.38, p < .01) interleukin-6 levels, and significantly decreased daytime (beta = 0.35, p = .01) cortisol levels. In contrast, subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale/Sleepiness Scale) was not associated with either elevated interleukin-6 levels or decreased cortisol levels. Our findings suggest that obstructive sleep apnea with objective excessive daytime sleepiness is the more severe phenotype of the disorder associated with low-grade inflammation, a link to cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality. Compared to subjective excessive daytime sleepiness, objective excessive daytime sleepiness is a stronger predictor of obstructive sleep apnea severity and may be useful in the clinical management of the disorder.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Temporal Changes in the Cerebrospinal Fluid Level of Hypocretin-1 and Histamine in Narcolepsy.  cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels decreased from normal/intermediate to undetectable levels in three of the four patients with definite cataplexy and remained stable in the other (>250 pg/mL). Hypocretin level decreased from 106 to 27 pg/mL in one patient with atypical cataplexy, and remained stable in the other (101 and 106 pg/mL). cerebrospinal fluid histamine and tele-methylhistamine levels remained stable, but for one patient showing increased frequency of cataplexy and a strong decrease (-72.5%) of tele-methylhistamine levels several years after disease onset. No significant association was found between relative or absolute change in hypocretin level and demographic/clinical features. These findings show that in few patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy, symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid marker levels can change over time. In these rare patients with cataplexy without baseline hypocretin deficiency, cerebrospinal fluid markers should be monitored over time with potential for immune therapies in early stages to try limiting hypocretin neuron loss.\n",

Furthermore, in patients with type 1 narcolepsy, levels of total tau protein (79.0 +/- 27.5 pg/mL) and P-tau181 (19.1 +/- 4.3 pg/mL) were lower than in controls (162.2 +/- 49.9 pg/mL and 33.8 +/- 9.2 pg/mL, p < .05). Levels of alpha-synuclein, neurofilament light chain, and chitinase 3-like protein-1 in cerebrospinal fluid from narcolepsy patients were similar to those of healthy individuals. Six cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of neurodegeneration were decreased or normal in narcolepsy indicating that taupathy, synucleinopathy, and immunopathy are not prevalent in narcolepsy patients with a disease duration of 2-29 years. Lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of beta-amyloid, total tau protein protein, and P-tau181 in narcolepsy may indicate that hypocretin deficiency and an abnormal sleep-wake pattern alter the turnover of these proteins in the central nervous system.\n",
      "Processing abstract: CD4+ T-Cell Reactivity to Orexin/Hypocretin in Patients With Narcolepsy Type 1. Narcolepsy type 1 is accompanied by a selective loss of orexin/hypocretin (hcrt) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus caused by yet unknown mechanisms. Epidemiologic and genetic associations strongly suggest an immune-mediated pathogenesis of the disease. Using these criteria, 3/15 patients (20%) and 0/13 controls (0%) showed orexin/hcrt-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation (p = .2262). The heterogeneous reactivity pattern did not allow the identification of a preferential target epitope. A significant role of orexin/hcrt-specific T cells in narcolepsy type 1 patients could not be confirmed in this study. Further studies are needed to assess the exact role of CD4+ T cells and possible target antigens in narcolepsy type 1 patients.\n",

After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years (SD = 4.3 years), 50 (27.9%) patients developed neurodegenerative diseases. There was a significantly higher proportion of conversion in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness compared to those without excessive daytime sleepiness (42.2 % vs. 23.1%, p = .01). excessive daytime sleepiness significantly predicted an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases (adjusted hazard ratios [HR] = 2.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37 to 4.77) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, current depression, obstructive sleep apnea, and periodic limb movements during sleep. Further analyses demonstrated that excessive daytime sleepiness predicted the conversion of Parkinson's disease (PD) (adjusted HR = 3.55, 95% CI 1.59 to 7.89) but not dementia (adjusted HR = 1.48, 95% CI 0.44 to 4.97). excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with an increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, especially PD, in patients with idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder.

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited neuromuscular disease causing, among other symptoms, fatigue and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are frequently undifferentiated by patients and/or clinicians. The Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale (Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale) has been devised to measure these two overlapping symptoms as a single clinical entity. The Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale showed good intra-rater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient=0.83) and acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha =0.6). Also, the Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale was able to distinguish between patients who had fatigue and sleepiness complaints from those who did not (mean Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale score of 10.6 vs 8.0, p=0.01), suggesting good construct validity. Overall, the present study supports the continued use of the Fatigue and Daytime Sleepiness Scale as a reliable and valid instrument to measure fatigue and daytime sleepiness in patients with DM1 for either clinical or research purposes.\n",

Associations between influenza infection and sleep disorders are poorly studied. We investigated if pandemic influenza infection or vaccination with Pandemrix in 2009/2010 was associated with narcolepsy or hypersomnia in children and young adults. Among the 1,638,526 persons under age 30 in Norway in 2009, 3.6% received a physician diagnosis of influenza during the pandemic, while 41.9% were vaccinated against pandemic influenza. Between October 1st 2009 and December 31st 2012, 72 persons had onset of narcolepsy and 305 were diagnosed with hypersomnia. The risk of a sleep disorder was associated with infection during the first six months, adjusted HR 3.31 with 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-10.79 for narcolepsy and adjusted HR 3.13 (95% CI, 1.12-8.76) for hypersomnia. The risk of narcolepsy was strongly associated with vaccination during the first six months adjusted HR 17.21 (95% CI, 6.28-47.14), while the adjusted HR for hypersomnia was 1.54 (95% CI, 0.81-2.93).

In those with symptoms indicative of obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea), respiratory-specific health-related quality of life (health-related quality of life) may be an important patient-centered outcome. The aim of this study was to assess the associations between sleepiness, fatigue, and impaired general and respiratory-specific health-related quality of life among persons with suspected obstructive sleep apnea. We studied 1578 veterans (median age 61.1 [IQR 16.8] years; 93.9% males). Of these, 823 (52%) met AHI criteria for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHI >=15/h). The majority reported excessive daytime sleepiness (53%; median ESS 11 [IQR 9]) or fatigue (61%; median FSS 42 [IQR 23]). The median AQ-20R was 4 [IQR 1-8]. Controlling for AHI, SF-12v2-PCS, respiratory co-morbid conditions, body mass index, and demographics, both ESS and FSS were significantly associated with poorer AQ-20R: for each; ESS, 1.6 points (95% CI 1.4-1.9), and for FSS, 2.5 points (95% CI, 2.3-2.7). Greater daytime sleepiness and fatigue are associated with poorer respiratory-specific health-related quality of life, over and above the effects of obstructive sleep apnea, respiratory comorbidity, and generic physical health-related quality of life.\n",

The sex subgroup efficacy analyses mirrored the improvements seen for suvorexant 40/30 and 20/15mg over placebo on patient-reported outcomes and polysomnography sleep maintenance and onset endpoints in the primary analyses; 95% CIs excluded zero in favor of suvorexant for most endpoints in both sexes, and similar efficacy was observed between sexes (95% CIs overlapped). Suvorexant was well-tolerated in was somnolence and men, although was somnolence in all treatment groups (including placebo) reported more adverse events than men. The most frequent adverse event was somnolence (was somnolence: 11.1% for 40/30mg, 8.5% for 20/15mg, 2.3% for placebo; men: 10.1% for 40/30mg, 3.4% for 20/15mg, 4.2% for placebo). Suvorexant was generally effective and well-tolerated in both was somnolence and men with insomnia. ClinicalTrials.gov trial registration numbers: NCT01097616, NCT01097629, NCT01021813.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Measurement of narcolepsy symptoms: The Narcolepsy Severity Scale.  The Narcolepsy Severity Scale showed good psychometric properties with significant item-total score correlations. The factor analysis indicated a 3-factor solution with good reliability, expressed by satisfactory Cronbach alpha values. The Narcolepsy Severity Scale total score temporal stability was good. Significant Narcolepsy Severity Scale score differences were observed between untreated and treated patients (dependent sample, 41 patients before and after sleep therapy; independent sample, 29 drug-free and 105 treated patients). Scores were lower in the treated populations (10-point difference between groups), without ceiling effect. Significant correlations were found among Narcolepsy Severity Scale total score and daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Mean Sleep Latency Test), depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life. The Narcolepsy Severity Scale can be considered a reliable and valid clinical tool for the quantification of narcolepsy symptoms to monitor and optimize narcolepsy management.\n",

Among the 31 patients (13 males and 18 females; mean [self-reported mean] disease duration, 5.9 [3.6] years), bright Light therapy resulted in significant improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (mean [self-reported mean], 15.81 [3.10] at baseline vs 11.19 [3.31] after the intervention). Both bright Light therapy and dim-red Light therapy were associated with improvements in sleep quality as captured by mean (self-reported mean) scores on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (7.88 [4.11] at baseline vs 6.25 [4.27] after bright Light therapy, and 8.87 [2.83] at baseline vs 7.33 [3.52] after dim-red Light therapy) and the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (97.24 [22.49] at baseline vs 106.98 [19.37] after bright Light therapy, and 95.11 [19.86] at baseline vs 99.28 [16.94] after dim-red Light therapy). Bright Light therapy improved several self-reported mean (self-reported mean) sleep metrics, including sleep fragmentation (number of overnight awakenings, 1.51 [1.03] at baseline vs 0.92 [0.97] after the intervention), sleep quality (sleep diary score, 3.03 [1.01] at baseline vs 3.53 [0.91] after the intervention), and ease of falling asleep (sleep diary score, 2.32 [0.89] at baseline vs 1.83 [0.88] after the intervention).

      "Processing abstract: Adolescent daytime sleepiness as a risk factor for adult crime. While recent cross-sectional research has documented a relationship between sleep problems and antisocial behavior, the longitudinal nature of this relationship is unknown. This study tests both the hypothesis that adolescent daytime sleepiness is associated with later adult criminal offending, and also tests a biopsychosocial mediation model in which social adversity predisposes to sleepiness, which in turn predisposes to attentional impairment, and to adult crime. Sleepy adolescents were more likely to be antisocial during adolescence, and were 4.5 times more likely to commit crime by age 29. The sleepiness-adult crime relationship withstood control for adolescent antisocial behavior. Self-report sleepiness predicted to adult crime over and above objective measures of daytime sleepiness (EEG theta activity) and age 15 antisocial behavior. Poor daytime attention partly mediated the sleep-crime relationship. Mediation analyses also showed that social adversity predisposed to daytime sleepiness which was associated with reduced attention which in turn predisposed to adult crime. Findings are the first to document a longitudinal association between sleepiness in adolescence and crime in adulthood. The longitudinal nature of this relationship, controlling for age 15 antisocial behavior, is consistent with the hypothesis that adolescent sleepiness predisposes to later antisociality. Findings are also consistent with the notion that the well-established link between social adversity and adult crime is partly explained by sleepiness. Results suggest that a very brief and simple assessment of subjective daytime sleepiness may have prognostic clinical value, and that interventions to reduced sleepiness could be a useful avenue for future crime prevention.\n",

Whilst the majority of evidence supports the adjunctive use of eicosapentaenoic acid (eicosapentaenoic acid) in improving mood, to date no study exists using low-dose docosahexaenoic acid (docosahexaenoic acid) alone as an adjunctive treatment in patients with mild to moderate major depressive disorder (major depressive disorder). After 8 weeks, 54% of patients had a >=50% reduction on the HAM-D, and 45% were in remission (HAM-D<=7). The eta-squared statistic (0.59) indicated a large effect size for the reduction of depression (equivalent to Cohen's d of 2.4). However confidence in this effect size is tempered due to the lack of a placebo. The mean score for the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale was significantly improved by 1.28 points (P<0.05). Despite a significant reduction in the HAM-D score for middle insomnia (P=0.02), the reduction in excessive daytime somnolence on the total Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) did not reach significance. No significant adverse reactions to docosahexaenoic acid were found. Within the major limits of this open-label pilot study, the results suggest that docosahexaenoic acid may provide additional adjunctive benefits in patients with mild- to -moderate depression.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Diagnostic value of sleep stage dissociation as visualized on a 2-dimensional sleep state space in human narcolepsy. Type 1 narcolepsy (NT1) is characterized by symptoms believed to represent Rapid Eye Movement (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep stage dissociations, occurrences where features of wake and Rapid Eye Movement sleep are intermingled, resulting in a mixed state. We hypothesized that sleep stage dissociations can be objectively detected through the analysis of nocturnal Polysomnography (Polysomnography) data, and that those affecting Rapid Eye Movement sleep can be used as a diagnostic feature for narcolepsy. Eight prominent features could differentiate narcolepsy and controls in the validation dataset. Using a composite measure and a specificity cut off 95% in the training dataset, sensitivity was 43%. Specificity/sensitivity was 94%/38% in the validation set. Using hypersomnia subjects, specificity/sensitivity was 84%/15%. Analyzing treated narcoleptics the specificity/sensitivity was 94%/10%. Sleep stage dissociation can be used for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. However the use of some medications and presence of undiagnosed hypersomnolence patients impacts the result.\n",

Heterogeneity among the different antipsychotics regarding activating or sedating adverse events was observed, with some agents displaying the potential for both activating and sedating properties. For agents indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, predominantly activating medications include lurasidone (number needed to harm, 11 for akathisia vs 20 for somnolence) and cariprazine (number needed to harm, 15 for akathisia vs 65 for somnolence-combined terms). Similarly activating and sedating are risperidone (number needed to harm, 15 for akathisia vs 13 for sedation) and aripiprazole (number needed to harm, 31 for akathisia vs 34 for somnolence). Predominantly sedating are olanzapine, quetiapine immediate and extended release, ziprasidone, asenapine, and iloperidone. Agents that are neither activating nor sedating are paliperidone and brexpiprazole. For major depressive disorder, the overall findings regarding activation and sedation appear similar to those seen with schizophrenia. Data extracted were limited to those available from registrational studies that contributed to the adverse event tables contained in the product labels. Postregistrational comparative studies may yield different outcomes.

      "Processing abstract: Symptoms of major depression: Their stability, familiality, and prediction by genetic, temperamental, and childhood environmental risk factors. Psychiatry has long sought to develop biological diagnostic subtypes based on symptomatic differences. This effort assumes that symptoms reflect, with good fidelity, underlying etiological processes. We address this question for major depression (major depression). In twins with major depression at two different waves, the mean tetrachoric correlations (+/-SEM) for aggregated and disaggregated DSM-IV A criteria were, respectively, +0.31 +/- 0.06 and +0.34 +/- 0.03. In monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs concordant for last-year major depression, the mean tetrachoric correlations for aggregated and disaggregated criteria were, respectively, +0.33 +/- 0.07 and +0.43 +/- 0.04, and +0.05 +/- 0.08 and +0.07 +/- 0.04. In individuals meeting major depression criteria, neuroticism predicted the most major depression symptoms (10), followed by childhood sexual abuse (8), low parental warmth (6), and genetic risk (4). The correlations for individual depressive symptoms over multiple episodes and within MZ twins concordant for major depression are modest suggesting the important role of transient influences. The multidetermination of individual symptoms was further evidenced by their prediction by personality and exposure to early life adversities. The multiple factors influencing symptomatic presentation in major depression may contribute to our difficulties in isolating clinical depressive subtypes with distinct pathophysiologies.\n",

Narcolepsy causes abnormalities in the control of wake-sleep, non-rapid-eye-movement (non-rapid-eye-movement) sleep and REM sleep, which includes specific eye movements (eye movements). In this study, we aim to evaluate EM characteristics in narcolepsy as compared to controls using an automated detector.

Furthermore, NT1 patients showed less eye movements during NREM sleep in the first sleep cycle and more eye movements during NREM sleep in the second sleep cycle compared to clinical controls and NT2 patients. NT1 patients show an altered distribution of eye movements across sleep stages and cycles compared to NT2 patients and clinical controls, suggesting that eye movements are directly or indirectly controlled by the hypocretinergic system. A data-driven EM detector may contribute to the evaluation of narcolepsy and other disorders involving the control of eye movements.\n",

Eight participants had insomnia after the first 5 sessions, and three in group 2 had nocturnal hyperkinesia after 15 sessions. A seizure during decompression was observed in 2/59 participants (2/419 sessions). These results indicate that HBO<sub>2</sub> therapy is beneficial to improve sleep and is safe for children with cerebral palsy; however, further studies are necessary to explore the mechanisms of HBO<sub>2</sub> on sleep.\n",

Sixty patients (M/F=9/51) with a mean (+/-SD) age of 34.7+/-9.2years and body mass index (body mass index) of 46.04+/-7.52kg/m<sup>2</sup> were studied. Bariatric surgery improved Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (6.4+/-3.8 versus 4.1+/-2.8; p<0.001), Epworth Sleepiness Scale score (8.1+/-4.7 versus 6.0+/-3.3; p<0.001), Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form score (9.8+/-7.0 versus 4.7+/-4.6; p=0.001), and risk for OSA (68.3 versus 5%). Twelve of the 18 subjects with baseline excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale>=10) developed normal Epworth Sleepiness Scale score after surgery. In these subjects, significant postoperative improvement in depressive symptoms score was observed (12.0+/-9.0 versus 5.5+/-5.0; p=0.041), in contrast to the remaining six cases with persistent excessive daytime sleepiness, who showed no significant change in these symptoms (5.5+/-5.0 versus 3.2+/-3.1; p=0.416). Bariatric surgery has a beneficial effect on sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Postoperative improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness can be related to a reduction in depressive symptoms.\n",

Eight whole-text papers containing nine separate studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the narrative analysis. Few of these studies met all of the quality assessment criteria. The studies used a range of self-reported measures and objective measures, including polysomnography. Mixed evidence was obtained for some of the individual sleep outcomes, but overall compared with controls, primary SS patients reported greater subjective sleep disturbances and daytime somnolence and demonstrated more night awakenings and pre-existing obstructive sleep apnoea. A range of sleep disturbances are commonly reported in primary SS patients. Further polysomnography studies are recommended to confirm the increased prevalence of night awakenings and obstructive sleep apnoea in this patient group. primary SS patients with excessive daytime somnolence should be screened for co-morbid sleep disorders and treated appropriately. Interventions targeted at sleep difficulties in primary SS, such as cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia and nocturnal humidification devices, have the potential to improve quality of life in this patient group and warrant further investigation.\n",

      "Processing abstract: A transdiagnostic sleep and circadian treatment to improve severe mental illness outcomes in a community setting: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Severe mental illness (Severe mental illness) is common, chronic and difficult to treat. Sleep and circadian dysfunctions are prominent correlates of Severe mental illness, yet have been minimally studied in ways that reflect the complexity of the sleep problems experienced. Prior treatment studies have been disorder-focused-they have treated a specific sleep problem in a specific diagnostic group. However, real life sleep and circadianproblems are not so neatly categorized, particularly in Severe mental illness where features of insomnia overlap with hypersomnia, delayed sleep phase and irregular sleep-wake schedules. Accordingly, the aim of this studyprotocol is to test the hypothesis that a Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction (Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction) will improve functional impairment, disorder-focused symptoms and sleep and circadian functioning. Participants across DSM diagnoses and across common sleep and circadian problems are eligible. The elements of Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction are efficacious across Severe mental illness in research settings with research-based providers. The next step is to test Transdiagnostic Intervention for Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction in a community setting.

Participants reporting daytime sleepiness differed significantly from those without in gait speed (adjusted difference (standard error (SE)) -0.09 (0.04) m/s, P = .03), step width (adjusted difference (SE) 0.02 (0.01), P = .03), and self-reported balance confidence (adjusted difference (SE) -1.02 (0.38), P = .01) even after adjusting for covariates. Two-way analysis of variance of central nervous system medication use and daytime sleepiness showed no significant interaction effects. Self-reported daytime sleepiness is associated with slower gait speed and poor balance confidence in community-dwelling older adults. Subjective sleep assessment should be considered when assessing balance and implementing interventions for improving balance in older adults. Further study is needed to examine the role of central nervous system medication use.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Listening to the Patient Voice in Narcolepsy: Diagnostic Delay, Disease Burden, and Treatment Efficacy.  Most participants reported receiving a diagnosis of narcolepsy more than 1 y after symptom onset. We found that the strongest predictor of this delayed diagnosis was pediatric onset of symptoms (odds ratio = 2.4, p < 0.0005). Depression was the most common comorbidity but we detected no association with pediatric onset of narcolepsy symptoms. Overall, participants reported that fatigue and cognitive difficulties were their most burdensome symptoms in addition to sleepiness and cataplexy. The majority of participants reported residual daytime fatigue and/or sleepiness despite treatment. Most participants reported they could not perform at work or school as well as they would like because of narcolepsy symptoms. This study provides unique insight into the narcolepsy disease experience. The study quantifies the problem of diagnostic delay for narcolepsy patients in the United States and highlights that symptoms are more likely to be missed if they develop before 18 y of age. These results suggest that narcolepsy awareness efforts should be aimed at parents, pediatric health care providers, school professionals, and children/adolescents themselves. Disease burden is high because of problems with fatigue, cognition, and persistence of residual symptoms despite treatment.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Sleep Alterations in Non-demented Older Individuals: The Role of Cortisol. Sleep alterations can impair quality of life and contribute to disease progression but they, and their features and contributing factors, are rarely analysed in institutionalised older individuals. In this study, we investigated sleep alterations, the factors involved, and the role of cortisol in sleep-related problems in institutionalised individuals. The mean age was 82.5 years (range: 65-99); approximately 80% were women and sleep alterations were present in 25-60% of the population, depending on the scale used or type of sleep disorder considered. There was no significant correlation between morning cortisol concentrations and sleep disorders, sex, age, or psychotropic drug ingestion (including hypnotic drugs). However, there was a significant correlation between cortisol and an Oviedo questionnaire subscale for evaluating insomniarelated adverse events, which remained significant after adjusting for multiple potentially confounding factors. Sleep disorders are common in institutionalised older individuals and are not related to sleep duration or decreased by ingestion of hypnotic medications. There is a significant relationship between morning cortisol levels in blood and insomnia-related sleep disorders (e.g. snoring with awakenings, nightmares, restless legs syndrome, etc.) but not directly with insomnia or hypersomnia.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Sleep Apnea, Sleep Debt and Daytime Sleepiness Are Independently Associated with Road Accidents. A Cross-Sectional Study on Truck Drivers. Recent research has found evidence of an association between motor vehicle accidents (motor vehicle accidents) or near miss accidents (near miss accidents), and excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) or its main medical cause, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (Obstructive Sleep Apnea). However, excessive daytime sleepiness can also be due to non-medical factors, such as sleep debt (sleep debt), which is common among professional truck drivers. On the opposite side, rest breaks and naps are known to protect against accidents. motor vehicle accidents and near miss accidents were reported by 34.8% and 9.2% of participants, respectively. motor vehicle accidents were significantly predicted by Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OR = 2.32 CI95% = 1.68-3.20), sleep debt (OR = 1.45 CI95% = 1.29-1.63), excessive daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.73 CI95% = 1.15-2.61) and prevented by naps (OR = 0.59 CI95% = 0.44-0.79) or rest breaks (OR = 0.63 CI95% = 0.45-0.89). near miss accidents were significantly predicted by Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OR = 2.39 CI95% = 1.47-3.87) and sleep debt (OR = 1.49 CI95% = 1.27-1.76) and prevented by naps (OR = 0.52 CI95% = 0.32-0.85) or rest breaks (OR = 0.49 CI95% = 0.29-0.82). When Obstructive Sleep Apnea, sleep debt or excessive daytime sleepiness are present, the risk of motor vehicle accidents or near miss accidents in truck drivers is severely increased. Taking a rest break or a nap appear to be protective against accidents.\n",

      "Processing abstract: The association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality in residential aged care facilities: a cross-sectional study. Benzodiazepines are commonly prescribed in residential aged care facilities (residential aged care facilities) for their sedative and anxiolytic effects. The objective of this study was to investigate the association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality in residents of residential aged care facilities. Of the 383 residents (mean age 87.5 years, 77.5% female), 96(25.1%) used a benzodiazepine on a regular basis. Residents who used long-acting benzodiazepines on a regular basis had higher night-time sleep quality than non-users (AOR=4.00, 95%CI 1.06 - 15.15). Residents who used short-acting benzodiazepines on a PRN only basis had longer daytime napping times than non-users (AOR=1.77, 95%CI 1.01 - 3.08). No benzodiazepine category was associated with day-time drowsiness. The association between benzodiazepine use and sleep quality is dependent on the half-life and prescribing pattern of the benzodiazepine. Short-acting PRN benzodiazepines were associated with lower night time sleep quality and longer day-time napping compared to long-acting regular benzodiazepines. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether these findings reflect channeling of short-acting agents to residents at higher risk of sleep disorders.\n",

We systematically searched AE reports, coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), using Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQs) with 'broad' and 'narrow' preferred terms related to dementia. In PARADIGM-HF, 8399 patients aged 18-96 years were randomized and followed for a median of 2.25years (up to 4.3years). The narrow SMQ search identified 27 dementia-related adverse effects: 15 (0.36%) on enalapril and 12 (0.29%) on sacubitril/valsartan [hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33-1.59].

The rates of dementia-related adverse effects in both treatment groups in PARADIGM-HF were similar to those in three other recent trials in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. We found no evidence that sacubitril/valsartan, compared with enalapril, increased dementia-related adverse effects, although longer follow-up may be necessary to detect such a signal and more sensitive tools are needed to detect lesser degrees of cognitive impairment.

      "Processing abstract: Pharmacotherapies for sleep disturbances in dementia. Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering, and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia, and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs, and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population. We found six randomised controlled trials eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (222 participants, four studies, but only two yielded data on our primary sleep outcomes suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study), and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, limited information available).The participants in the trazodone study and almost all participants in the melatonin studies had moderate-to-severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease); those in the ramelteon study had mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Participants had a variety of common sleep problems at baseline. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the evidence was at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting, some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties, and a high risk of selective reporting in one trial that contributed very few participants. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, at doses up to 10 mg, improved any major sleep outcome over 8 to 10 weeks in patients with Alzheimer's disease who were identified as having a sleep disturbance. We were able to synthesize data for two of our primary sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (mean difference (MD) 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59; N = 184; two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03; N = 184; two studies). From single studies, we found no difference between melatonin and placebo groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, or number of night-time awakenings. From two studies, we found no effect of melatonin on cognition or performance of activities of daily living (Alzheimer's diseaseL). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies. We considered this evidence to be of low quality.There was low-quality evidence that trazodone 50 mg given at night for two weeks improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0; N = 30; one study), and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53%, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1; N = 30; one study) in patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease, but it did not affect the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6; N = 30; one study), or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8; N = 30; one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, cognition, or Alzheimer's diseaseL. No serious adverse effects of trazodone were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Because the data were from a single, small study and reporting was incomplete, we considered this evidence to be of low quality in general terms. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural, or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects from ramelteon. We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in dementia. In particular, we found no randomised controlled trials of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in dementia, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin (up to 10mg) helped sleep problems in patients with moderate to severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. There was some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in dementia. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Depression with atypical features in various kinds of affective disorders.  Patients with various types of depression did not differ significantly in terms of clinical and demographic factors. Symptoms of atypical depression such as increased appetite, weight gain and leaden paralysis were more common in women. Patients with bipolar depression had significantly increased symptoms such as hypersomnia (compared with dysthymia), and leaden paralysis (vs. recurrent depression and dysthymia). In overweight and obese patients, the severity of atypical symptoms correlated with body mass index and intensity of depression score on the 17-items Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. In this group, all symptoms of atypical depression were significantly more intense in patients with depression in the course of bipolar disorder. The results indicate higher prevalence of symptoms of atypical depression in bipolar disorder compared with recurrent depression and dysthymia. They also suggest the interdependency between the symptoms of atypical depression, bipolar disorder and obesity.\n",

The final population included 9,312 narcolepsy subjects and 46,559 controls (each group, mean age = 46.1 years; 59% female). All categories of mental illness were significantly more prevalent in patients with narcolepsy versus controls, with the highest excess prevalence noted for CCS 5.8 Mood disorders (37.9% vs 13.8%; odds ratio [OR] = 4.0; 95% CI, 3.8-4.2), CCS 5.8.2 Depressive disorders (35.8% vs 13.0%; OR = 3.9; 95% CI, 3.7-4.1), and CCS 5.2 Anxiety disorders (25.1% vs 11.9%; OR = 2.5; 95% CI, 2.4-2.7). Excess prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders (narcolepsy vs controls) was higher in younger age groups versus older age groups. Psychiatric medication usage was higher in the narcolepsy group versus controls in the following categories: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (36% vs 17%), anxiolytic benzodiazepines (34% vs 19%), hypnotics (29% vs 13%), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (21% vs 6%), and tricyclic antidepressants (13% vs 4%) (all P values < .0001).

A total of 139 (49.1%) subjects had suspected obstructive sleep apnea, and the Polysomnography study confirmed the diagnosis in 35.7%. A significant association between obstructive sleep apnea severity and near miss accidents was observed, and subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea showed a near five-fold increased risk of near miss accidents (OR=4.745, 95% CI 1.292-17.424, p=0.019). After two years of continuous positive airway pressure treatment, the rate of near miss accidents was comparable with drivers without obstructive sleep apnea, showing the efficacy of therapy. This study showed an unexpected high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in truck drivers of dangerous goods. Untreated subjects with severe obstructive sleep apnea had a significantly increased risk of near miss accidents. In professional drivers, screening, treatment, and management of obstructive sleep apnea are mandatory for reducing road accident risk and improving road safety.\n",

The children with type 1 narcolepsy showed higher body mass indexs at follow-up assessments. At the end of the study, 38.46% of the patients were obese and an additional 26.15% were overweight. The patients' body mass index growth at six, 12, 18, 24 and 30 months of follow-up was significantly higher, but not at month 36. The patients' basal energy expenditure was significantly lower than that of the controls at six months but not at 36 months. body mass index increased rapidly in children with type 1 narcolepsy after disease onset, but body mass index growth decreased gradually with prolonged disease. Decreased basal metabolic rate is an important cause underlying rapid weight gain. The gradual restoration of body mass index growth and basal metabolic rate in narcolepsy emphasizes the importance of compensatory metabolic mechanisms in this disease.\n",

One in ten lived near a busy road, 6% slept in a bedroom with traffic noise, and 11% travelled regularly along busy roads. Habitual snoring affected 25% and daytime sleepiness 21%. More men reported snoring and more women reported daytime sleepiness. Having a bedroom with traffic noise was associated with snoring (adjusted OR 1.29, [95% CI 1.12, 1.48]). For daytime sleepiness, on the other hand, bedroom with traffic noise and high exposure to traffic pollution have significant risk factors (adjusted ORs 1.46 [1.11, 1.92] and 1.65 [1.11, 2.45]). Results were consistent across study centres. Daytime sleepiness is associated with traffic pollution and traffic noise, while habitual snoring is only associated with traffic noise. Self-reported traffic exposure should be taken into account when diagnosing and planning treatment for patients with sleep disturbances, because reducing noise and pollution exposure in the bedroom may have a beneficial effect.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Age-related differences in sleep-dependent consolidation of motor skills in patients with narcolepsy type 1.  The pattern of sleep-dependent consolidation was significantly different in the two groups of patients: while performance accuracy was higher in adults compared with children at each session, performance speed improved after daytime sleep in children and after nighttime sleep in adults. The improvement in performance speed, although not related with any sleep parameters in both groups, was positively correlated with the daytime and nighttime total sleep time (total sleep time) in children with greater consolidation gain. The interaction between time of day and age in the time course of consolidation of new motor skills discloses a different role of daytime sleep (active in children, simply protective from interferences in adults) in NT1 patients and suggests a flexible use of napping in the educational context.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Impact of sodium oxybate, modafinil, and combination treatment on excessive daytime sleepiness in patients who have narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. Effects of sodium oxybate (sodium oxybate) on patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy with cataplexy) or without cataplexy (NWOC) have not been separately evaluated in clinical trials. Among narcolepsy with cataplexy and NWOC patients, ESS improvement was significantly greater with sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate+modafinil versus placebo. In narcolepsy with cataplexy patients, mean MWT sleep latency was significantly increased with sodium oxybate+modafinil versus placebo. In NWOC patients, mean MWT sleep latency significantly increased in all groups versus placebo. Higher percentages of patients in the sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate+modafinil groups were \"very much improved\" or \"much improved\" on the CGI-C versus placebo in both narcolepsy with cataplexy and NWOC populations, although the difference did not reach statistical significance in the NWOC populations. Adverse events were consistent with previously-reported profiles for modafinil and sodium oxybate. Nausea was more common in the sodium oxybate and sodium oxybate+modafinil groups. Dizziness and tremor were more common in the sodium oxybate+modafinil group only. sodium oxybate alone and in combination with modafinil improved subjective ratings of excessive sleepiness and an objective measure of the ability to stay awake to similar extents in narcolepsy with cataplexy patients and NWOC patients.\n",

Sleep macrostructure was comparable between controls and patients, with the latter having significantly longer sleep time, a higher number of sleep cycles (p<0.0001), and low sleep efficiency (p<0.01). The heart rate variability indices did not differ between groups, except for the rise of high frequency (high frequency) and high frequencynu in patients (p<0.05) associated with blunted sympathetic indices (p<0.01). These parasympathetic alterations were present for light, slow wave, and rapid eye-movement sleep and persisted for all sleep cycles. Compared to controls, the heart rate arousal response was significantly higher (p<0.01) in patients starting before the arousal onset and persisting into the post-arousal period. In idiopathic hypersomnia patients a dysfunction of the parasympathetic activity during awake and sleep and an altered autonomic response to arousals are present. These findings suggest an impaired parasympathetic function that may explain some vegetative symptoms present in this type of central hypersomnia.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep and sleepiness in environmental intolerances: a population-based study. About one fourth of the general population report environmental intolerance (environmental intolerance) to odorous/pungent chemicals, certain buildings, electromagnetic fields (electromagnetic fields), and/or sounds. environmental intolerance sufferers show various clinical features, of which sleep disturbance is one. Sleep disturbance is common also in the general population, but it is not known whether the disturbance is more prominent in environmental intolerance sufferers than in individuals who do not experience environmental intolerance. Therefore, environmental intolerance was compared on various sleep aspects with referents without environmental intolerance. All four environmental intolerance groups, compared to the referents, reported significantly poorer sleep quality, more non-restorative sleep, more daytime sleepiness, more obstructive breathing and higher prevalence of nocturnal insomnia than the referents. Nocturnal insomnia was an important factor for environmental intolerance groups attributing their most prevalent symptoms to chemicals and sounds, irrespective of distress and certain syndromes. None of the environmental intolerance groups differed significantly from the referents on time slept, but reported needing more sleep time (the EMF-intolerance group showing only a tendency), and all four groups reported to perceive enough sleep to a significantly lesser extent. Sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness are more common in individuals reporting environmental intolerance compared to normal referents. Moreover, nocturnal insomnia is an important symptom in its own right in various types of environmental intolerance. This evokes the question of whether or not sleep therapy may attenuate the severity of the environmental intolerance.\n",

Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness), which is commonly considered a cardinal sign of obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea), may lead to an increased rate of metabolic syndrome (metabolic syndrome), and be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the role of Excessive daytime sleepiness in metabolic syndrome and its components by researching severe obstructive sleep apnea patients. The prevalence of central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and metabolic syndrome (78.2% vs 28.6%) was significantly higher among Excessive daytime sleepiness group compared with control group. Compared with non-Excessive daytime sleepiness patients, patients with Excessive daytime sleepiness showed significantly higher metabolic score (3.22+/-0.94 vs 1.96+/-1.06). After adjustment for confounders, ESS score, log insulin and age significantly predicted the metabolic score (beta=0.567, P=0.000; beta=0.197, P=0.001 and beta=0.118, P=0.048, respectively). Excessive daytime sleepiness was independently correlated with the sum of metabolic components in severe obstructive sleep apnea patients. Our study suggested that Excessive daytime sleepiness might be a potentially useful clinical marker to identify patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea at risk of metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Gamma aminobutyric acid (Gamma aminobutyric acid) receptor agonists for acute stroke. Gamma aminobutyric acid (Gamma aminobutyric acid) receptor agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotectant effect in reducing infarct size and improving functional outcome in animal models of cerebrovascular disease. However, the sedative effects of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists have limited their wider application in people with acute stroke, due to the potential risk of stupor. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2013, and previously updated in 2014. We included five trials with 3838 participants (3758 analyzed). The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with an unclear risk for selection bias only. Four trials (N = 2909) measured death and dependency at three months for chlormethiazole versus placebo; pooled results did not find a significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.11). One trial (N = 849) measured this outcome for diazepam versus placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07). The most frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95; two trials; N = 2527) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46; two trials; N = 2527). This review provides moderate-quality evidence that fails to support the use of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of people with acute stroke. More well-designed randomized controlled trials with large samples of participants with total anterior circulation syndrome are required to determine if there are benefits for this subgroup. Somnolence and rhinitis are frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole.\n",

Inadequate asthma control (Asthma Control Test <20) was found in 94 (76.4%) subjects, depressive symptoms in 92 (74.8%), poor quality sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index >5) in 99 (80.49%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale >=10) in 34 (27.64%). Depressive symptoms were associated with both poor quality sleep (R=0.326) and inadequate asthma control (R=-0.299). Regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms and sleep quality were independent predictors of the level of asthma control. Asthma control in women is independently associated with depressive symptoms and quality of sleep, suggesting that these patients might benefit from simple measures to promote healthy sleep behavior and sleep hygiene and also that routine screening for depression can be relevant, particularly, in poorly controlled cases.\n",

Major depressive disorder (Major depressive disorder) is a debilitating psychiatric illness with a high cost burden. This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of adjunctive brexpiprazole versus comparator branded adjunctive treatment for Major depressive disorder and background antidepressant therapy (antidepressant therapy) alone from a US payer perspective. In the base-case analysis, brexpiprazole as reference treatment resulted in cost per additional responder ranging from $19,442-$48,745 and cost per additional remitter ranging from $27,196-$71,839 versus comparator treatments over 48 weeks. Sensitivity analyses showed treatment with brexpiprazole was more costly, but more clinically effective in all probabilistic simulations. This representation of disease natural history over 48 weeks may not account for all possible health states. Resource utilization on treatment was estimated using the resource use data from previous trials, and may overestimate medical costs compared to the real-world setting.

ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00021528. Suicidal ideation was more likely to occur early in citalopram treatment, with few subjects showing emergence or worsening occurring after 6 weeks of treatment. Clinical variables explained very little of the variance in worsening or emergence of suicidal ideation with citalopram treatment (generalized R(2) <= 2% in survival analysis). Being Hispanic, taking sedative medications, increased depression severity, absence of hypersomnia, and cardiac comorbidity were significantly (P <= .04) associated with greater likelihood of emergence of suicidal ideation in patients without suicidal ideation at baseline. Being widowed, better work performance, weight loss at baseline, and the presence of vascular or neurologic comorbidities were associated with a greater likelihood of worsening of suicidal ideation. Baseline clinical variables were poor predictors of emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation. As such, increased research focusing on clinical correlates rather than clinical predictors of suicidal ideation may be useful, as intervening events may be crucial in bringing about increased suicidality.\n",

In early stage idiopathic Parkinson disease, rapid eye movement density correlated with the PDSS score (r = -0.63, P = 0.001) and the sleep-related questions of the NMSQuest score (r = 0.48, P = 0.017). REM density is reduced in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease and correlates with subjective scores on sleep impairment. As an indicator of persistent high sleep pressure, reduced rapid eye movement density in idiopathic Parkinson disease is eligible as a biomarker of excessive daytime sleepiness in idiopathic Parkinson disease. It possibly reflects direct involvement of the brainstem REM generation sites by the disease process. rapid eye movement density is a promising new tool for sleep research in idiopathic Parkinson disease.\n",

At 1-y follow-up reassessment, sodium oxybate treatment was associated with a significant BMI z-score reduction (-1.29 +/- 0.30, p < 0.0005) after adjusting for baseline age, sex, sleepiness, and BMI. NT1 onset in children/adolescents is associated with rapid weight gain up to overweight/obesity and precocious puberty without affecting growth. In our study, sodium oxybate treatment resulted in a significant weight reduction in NT1 overweight/obese patients at 1-y follow-up.\n",

Eight hundred fifty-eight males and 174 females were included. Male subjects had significantly higher body mass index (body mass index), larger waist circumference (waist circumference), and lower percent of overall body fat (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, and P<0.0001, respectively). The severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was significantly higher in male subjects (respiratory disturbance index 26.9+/-22.4 in males vs. 10.2+/-13.8 in females, P<0.0001). In male subjects, body mass index, waist circumference, and overall body fat were significantly associated with severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and had larger impacts on supine respiratory disturbance index than lateral respiratory disturbance index. Overall body fat was not associated with severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in female subjects, and there were no significant differences of the associations between all anthropometric parameters and respiratory disturbance indexs depending on sleep position. Evaluation of the correlation of anthropometric data with severity of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome should consider sleep position as well as gender.\n",

Habitual snoring (Habitual snoring) was reported in 104 (5.3%) children. difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness were seen in 137 children (6.9%) and 117 children (5.9%), respectively. The prevalence of difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep increased from 3.5% in children who never snored to 28.6% in children who snored very often or always. Similarly, the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 2.7% in children who did not snore and increased to 19% in children who snored very often or always. No correlation was seen between increasing difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep (r=0.006, p>0.05) or excessive daytime sleepiness (r=-0.031, p>0.05) scores and body mass index. This study is the first to measure the symptoms of both difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness in a general pediatric population and to assess the relationship between both difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep-disordered breathing in children. We found that children with more frequent snoring had a higher prevalence of difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep as well as excessive daytime sleepiness; however, there was no correlation between body mass index and either difficulty with initiation or maintenance of sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness symptom severity.\n",

There were no significant differences in Addenbrook Cognitive Examination scores. Average physical fitness assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery was lower in the Narcolepsy with cataplexy group. The frequency of meeting with family, friends, and participation in hobbies or sports did not differ between the two groups. Symptoms of Narcolepsy with cataplexy were present throughout life. Comorbidities and lower physical fitness, which are known to be present in young and middle-aged Narcolepsy with cataplexy subjects, were also present in older patients.

      "Processing abstract: Discriminating Between Fatigue and Sleepiness in the Naval Operational Environment.  Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (8.41 +/- 4.66) indicated that 32% of the participants had excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 10), while approximately 7% had an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 16 or more. Fatigue Severity Scale scores (average Fatigue Severity Scale = 3.01 +/- 1.37) indicated that 28% of the participants had elevated fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale score >= 4). Even though Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Fatigue Severity Scale scores were correlated (r = 0.39), their association explained only 15% of the variability observed. In terms of behavioral and lifestyle patterns, crewmembers with elevated fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale >= 4) reported getting less exercise than those reporting less fatigue. Individuals with excessive sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) reported higher caffeine consumption. Crewmembers with elevated fatigue and comorbid sleepiness (Fatigue Severity Scale >= 4 and Epworth Sleepiness Scale > 10) reported receiving less sleep than other crew members. These results suggest that subjective fatigue and subjective sleepiness, as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scales, are distinct constructs and both are consequences of working at sea. The scores on the two scales correlate differentially with behavioral and lifestyle patterns of the crewmembers.\n",

Of 69 studies, Multiple sleep latency testing (43) and maintenance of wakefulness test (26), 16% of patients had positive urinary drug screening (7 Multiple sleep latency testing; 4 maintenance of wakefulness test). Drugs detected included amphetamines, cannabinoids, opiates, and benzodiazepines. No patient self-reported use of these medications prior to testing. No demographic, Multiple sleep latency testing or maintenance of wakefulness test polysomnography data or overnight polysomnography data showed any statistical differences between positive and negative drug screen groups. Of seven Multiple sleep latency testing patients testing positive for drug use, one met criteria for the diagnosis of narcolepsy and five for idiopathic hypersomnia. On maintenance of wakefulness test, three of the four drug-positive patients had a history of a motor vehicle accident and two patients were occupational drivers. These findings indicate drug use is present in patients attending for daytime testing of objective sleepiness and wakefulness. These data support routine urinary drug screening in all patients undergoing Multiple sleep latency testing or maintenance of wakefulness test studies to ensure accurate interpretation in the context of illicit and prescription drug use.\n",

Males admitted to residential drug treatment for methamphetamine use had an earlier age of onset for both methamphetamine use (17.7+/-4.1 vs 19.7+/-6.2 years; t=-5.3, P<0.001) and dependence (20.4+/-5.2 vs 22.2+/-6.4 years; t=-3.6, P<0.001). Females were more likely than males to be methamphetamine-dependent (79% vs 60%; chi1=33.7, P<0.001), and to experience methamphetamine withdrawal (65.3% vs 48.9%; chi1=21.4, P<0.001), withdrawal-related hypersomnia (77.2% vs 64.8%; chi1=14.5, P<0.001), fatigue (77.5% vs 70.3%; chi1=5.2, P=0.02), and psychomotor retardation (64.5% vs 57.0%; chi1=4.5, P=0.03). Similarly, females had heavier (eg, largest daily amount [chi1=12.4, P<0.001), more frequent (chi1=5.1, P=0.02]) and greater lifetime episodes of methamphetamine use (chi1=24.1, P<0.001) than males. After controlling for such variables by logistic regression, being female remained a significant factor influencing the occurrence of methamphetamine-dependence (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-4.1, P<0.001). Shared associated factors (or comorbidities) for methamphetamine-dependence in both sexes included nicotine dependence (in males: OR 4.1, 95% CI 2.4-7.0, P<0.001; and in females: OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3-4.4, P=0.007), greater lifetime episodes of methamphetamine use (in males: OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.9-6.4, P<0.001; and in females: OR 5.9, 95% CI 3.1-11.4, P<0.001), and more frequent use (in males: OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.8-9.1, P<0.001; and in females: OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9-6.9, P<0.001).

DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mark, controlled by DNA methyltransferase (DNA methyltransferase) proteins, which regulates chromatin structure and gene expression throughout the genome. In this study, we describe a family with adult-onset autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia with deafness and narcolepsy (ADCA-DN) caused by mutations in the maintenance methyltransferase DNA methyltransferase1 and assess the DNA methylation profile of these individuals. We report a family with six individuals affected with ADCA-DN; specifically, patients first developed hearing loss and ataxia, followed by narcolepsy, and cognitive decline. We identified a heterozygous DNA methyltransferase1 variant, c.1709C>T [p.Ala570Val] by Sanger sequencing, which had been previously reported as pathogenic for ADCA-DN and segregated with disease in the family. DNA methylation analysis by high-resolution genome-wide DNA methylation array identified a decrease in CpGs with 0-10% methylation and 80-95% methylation and a concomitant increase in sites with 10-30% methylation and >95% methylation. This pattern suggests an increase in methylation of normally unmethylated regions, such as promoters and CpG islands, as well as further methylation of highly methylated gene bodies and intergenic regions. Furthermore, a regional analysis identified 82 hypermethylated loci with consistent robust differences across >=5 consecutive probes compared to our large reference cohort. This report identifies robust changes in the DNA methylation patterns in ADCA-DN patients, which is an important step towards elucidating disease pathogenesis.\n",

Most of the Individual Case Safety Reports (61.9%) originated from the signaling countries, Sweden and Finland. Although de-duplication of case reports was carried out, it is suspected that many duplicates exist, in particular from Sweden.

Of those Individual Case Safety Reports reporting age, 73.1% concerned persons below age of 20years. When using the Automated Brighton Collaboration case definition tool, all Individual Case Safety Reports were classified as having insufficient information to meet the Brighton Collaboration case definition of narcolepsy. An increase in reporting of narcolepsy appeared in Eudravigilance only after awareness was raised by the national authorities. Most narcolepsy reports were received from countries where the signal initially occurred, and were related to Pandemrix(R) in children/adolescents. Basic information about the patient and the exposure was present in most of the Individual Case Safety Reports.

Schizophrenia is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder characterized, in part, by impaired dopamine signaling. TAK-063 is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 10A, a key regulator of intracellular signaling pathways that is highly expressed in the striatum. The most common drug-related adverse events (adverse events) were somnolence (33.3%), orthostatic tachycardia (19.7%), and orthostatic hypotension (9.1%). The three severe adverse events recorded occurred at the highest doses: orthostatic hypotension (n=1; 300mg) and somnolence (n=2; 1000mg). There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or discontinuations due to adverse events. TAK-063 exposure increased in a dose-dependent manner. Median T <sub>max</sub> was reached 3 to 4h postdose. Fed conditions slowed absorption (T <sub>max=</sub>6h) and increased oral bioavailability. Renal elimination was negligible. Safety and pharmacokinetic parameters were similar between Japanese and non-Japanese subjects. Impairments in cognitive function consistent with the effects of other sedative or hypnotic agents were detected using a validated, computerized cognition battery, CNS Vital Signs. TAK-063 was safe and well tolerated at doses up to 1000mg and demonstrated a pharmacokinetic profile supporting once-daily dosing.

Using multiple sleep latency testing, 35 (18.8%) of 186 patients had objective hypersomnia that may have been due to a drug or substance. Drugs or substances may have confounded the multiple sleep latency testing in 11 (20.1%) of 53 patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia, and 12 (52%) of 23 of those who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy without cataplexy. Of the 75 positive urine drug samples, 61 (81%) were substances or medications not revealed in the physician interview. The treating physician had not suspected drugs or substances as a possible cause of objective hypersomnia in 34 (97%) of the 35 patients. Drugs and psychoactive substances can confound the results of the multiple sleep latency testing and when undetected could lead to over diagnosis of central hypersomnias.\n",

However, while controls and idiopathic hypersomnia patients chose the devalued snack less often in the choice task, patients with narcolepsy still chose the devalued snack as often as before satiety. Subsequently, narcolepsy patients spontaneously consumed almost 4 times more calories during ad libitum snack intake. We show that the manipulation of food-specific satiety has reduced effects on food choices and caloric intake in narcolepsy type 1 patients. These mechanisms may contribute to their obesity, and suggest an important functional role for orexin in human eating behavior.\n",

At baseline, mean mESS score was 7.4 +/- 5.0 (SD) and mean Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire-Sleepiness Subscale score was 0.44 +/- 0.30. Sleepiness scores were higher in African American children; children with shorter sleep duration; older children; and overweight children. At endpoint, mean mESS score decreased by 2.0 +/- 4.2 in the early adenotonsillectomy group versus 0.3 +/- 4.0 in the waiting with supportive care group (P < 0.0001); mean Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire-Sleepiness Subscale score decreased 0.29 +/- 0.40 in early adenotonsillectomy versus 0.08 +/- 0.40 in the waiting with supportive care group (P < 0.0001). Despite higher baseline sleepiness, African American children experienced similar improvement with adenotonsillectomy than other children. Improvement in sleepiness was weakly associated with improved apnea-hypopnea index or oxygen desaturation indices, but not with change in other polysomnographic measures.

Increases in distal skin temperature and distal-to-proximal temperature gradient (distal-to-proximal temperature gradient) strongly predicted daytime sleep attacks (P < 0.001). As compared to controls, patients had a higher proximal and distal skin temperature in the morning, and a lower distal skin temperature during the night (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, they had a higher core body temperature during the first part of the night (P < 0.05), which sodium oxybate decreased (F = 4.99, df = 1, P = 0.03) to a level similar to controls. sodium oxybate did not affect skin temperature. This ambulatory study demonstrates that daytime sleep attacks were preceded by clear changes in distal skin temperature and distal-to-proximal temperature gradient. Furthermore, changes in core body and skin temperature in narcolepsy, previously only studied in laboratory settings, were partially confirmed. Treatment with sodium oxybate resulted in a normalisation of the core body temperature profile. Future studies should explore whether predictive temperature changes can be used to signal or even prevent sleep attacks.\n",

The plasma concentrations of oxycodone in patients with cachexia and refractory cachexia were significantly higher than that in patients with precachexia. The metabolic ratio to noroxycodone in patients with cachexia was significantly lower than that in patients with precachexia. The patients with a higher cachexia stage had a higher serum level of interleukin-6 (interleukin-6), but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta. The serum interleukin-6 level was correlated with the plasma concentration of oxycodone and inversely with the metabolic ratio to noroxycodone. The incidence of somnolence was not associated with the plasma oxycodone concentration. In contrast, the cachexia stage and its associated serum interleukin-6 level were correlated with the incidence of somnolence. Cancer cachexia raised the plasma exposure of oxycodone through the reduction of cytochrome P450 enzyme3A metabolic pathway. The reduction of cytochrome P450 enzyme3A in cachectic cancer patients was associated with an elevation of serum interleukin-6. Although cachectic cancer patients with higher serum interleukin-6 levels had the symptom of somnolence, the alterations in oxycodone pharmacokinetics were not related to the incidence of symptom.\n",

Person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions may positively influence the impact of shift work on sleep, thereby improving workers' well-being, safety, and health. We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence. Overall, the included studies' results were inconclusive. We present the results regarding sleepiness below. Bright light Combining two comparable studies (with 184 participants altogether) that investigated the effect of bright light during the night on sleepiness during a shift, revealed a mean reduction 0.83 score points of sleepiness (measured via the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to -0.36, very low quality evidence). Another trial did not find a significant difference in overall sleepiness on another sleepiness scale (16 participants, low quality evidence).Bright light during the night plus sunglasses at dawn did not significantly influence sleepiness compared to normal light (1 study, 17 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence).Bright light during the day shift did not significantly reduce sleepiness during the day compared to normal light (1 trial, 61 participants, subjective assessment, low quality evidence) or compared to normal light plus placebo capsule (1 trial, 12 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence). Napping during the night shiftA meta-analysis on a single nap opportunity and the effect on the mean reaction time as a surrogate for sleepiness, resulted in a 11.87 ms reduction (95% CI 31.94 to -8.2, very low quality evidence). Two other studies also reported statistically non-significant decreases in reaction time (1 study seven participants; 1 study 49 participants, very low quality evidence).A two-nap opportunity resulted in a statistically non-significant increase of sleepiness (subjective assessment) in one study (mean difference (MD) 2.32, 95% CI -24.74 to 29.38, 1 study, 15 participants, low quality evidence).

Major depressive disorder (Major depressive disorder) and generalized anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety disorder) often co-occur with somatic symptomatology. Little is known about the contributions of individual symptoms to this association and more insight into their relationships could help to identify symptoms that are central in the processes behind the co-occurrence. This study explores associations between individual Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder symptoms and somatic symptoms by using the network approach. The network structure showed numerous associations between Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder and somatic symptoms. In general, neurovegetative and cognitive/affective Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder symptoms showed a similar strength of connections to the somatic domain. However, associations varied substantially across individual symptoms. Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder symptoms with many and strong associations to the somatic domain included anxiety and fatigue, whereas hypersomnia and insomnia showed no connections to somatic symptoms. Among somatic symptoms, excessive perspiration and pressure/tight feeling in chest were associated with the Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder domain, while muscle pain and tingling in fingers showed only a few weak associations. Individual symptoms show differential associations in the co-occurrence of Major depressive disorder/generalized anxiety disorder with somatic symptomatology. Strongly interconnected symptoms are important in furthering our understanding of the interaction between the symptom domains, and may be valuable targets for future research and treatment.\n",

Several studies have proven Sleep-disordered breathing to represent an independent risk factor for stroke. Sleep studies in TIA and stroke patients are recommended in view of the very high prevalence (>50%) of Sleep-disordered breathing (Class IIb, level of evidence B). Treatment of obstructive Sleep-disordered breathing with continuous positive airway pressure is recommended given the strength of the increasing evidence in support of a positive effect on outcome (Class IIb, level of evidence B). Oxygen, biphasic positive airway pressure, and adaptive servoventilation may be considered in patients with central Sleep-disordered breathing. Recently, both reduced and increased sleep duration, as well as hypersomnia, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome (RLS), were also suggested to increase stroke risk. Mainly experimental studies found that sleep-wake disturbances may in addition impair neuroplasticity processes and functional stroke recovery. Treatment of sleep-wake disturbances with hypnotics and sedative antidepressants (insomnia), activating antidepressants or stimulants (hypersomnia), dopaminergic drugs (RLS), and clonazepam (parasomnias) are based on single case observations and should be used with caution. Sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-wake disturbances increase the risk of stroke in the general population and affect short- and long-term stroke recovery and outcome. Current knowledge supports the systematic implementation of clinical procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of poststroke Sleep-disordered breathing and sleep-wake disturbances on stroke units.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Polysomnographic findings in persistent allergic rhinitis.  There were no differences between groups for polysomnographic findings including sleep architecture, arousal and respiratory index, and mean and minimal oxygen saturations. Simple snoring was determined in 41.8% allergic and 32.6% non-allergic patients. Mild obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was determined in 32.7% allergic and 29.4% non-allergic patients. Moderate obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was determined in 9% allergic and 17.8% non-allergic patients. Severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was determined in 16.3% allergic and 20% non-allergic patients. Their entire Epworth sleepiness scale index was also found similar. Our data pointed out that in patients with sleep-related breathing disorders symptoms, presence of Persistent allergic rhinitis does not affect polysomnographic parameters compared with other patients without any nasal inflammation. Besides, prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was similar between groups.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with epilepsy: a meta-analysis.  The prevalence of mild-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with epilepsy was determined to be 33.4% (95% CI 20.8-46.1%), and patients with epilepsy are more susceptible to obstructive sleep apnoea as compared to healthy controls (odds ratio 2.36; 95% CI 1.33-4.18). Males were shown to be more susceptible to obstructive sleep apnoea than females (odds ratio 3.00; 95% CI 2.25-3.99). The results also indicated that the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with refractory epilepsy is not higher than the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with epilepsy overall (17.5 vs 33.4%). The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea was not found to be significantly different for different seizure types or in the number of antiepileptic drugs (antiepileptic drugs). Patients that had been treated with continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) were shown to have better seizure control than those untreated (odds ratio 5.26; 95% CI 2.04-13.5). The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea in patients with epilepsy is higher than in the general population. Additionally, the results of our study suggest that continuous positive airway pressure treatment results in a reduction of seizures.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Validity of the epworth sleepiness scale as a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea.  One hundred consecutive charts were included in this study. Mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was significantly higher when scored by the partner (10.4 +/- 5.8) compared to the subject (7.2 +/- 4.7). In 73% of cases, the subject underestimated their score compared to the score given by the partner. The mean difference in score was 3.2 +/- 3.5. Mean consensus Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 12.3 +/- 5.4. Using an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of >=10 as abnormal, subject scores did not correlate with the presence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA; P = .095). Partner and consensus scores, however, did correlate with the presence of OSA (P = .003 and P =.039, respectively). Thirty-five percent of our subjects did not drive. The difference in mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score obtained from the subject compared to partner implies that this diagnostic form should be completed as a consensus between the patient and partner to provide a more accurate score.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Excessive Daytime Sleepiness as an Indicator of Depression in Hispanic Americans. Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) has been shown to be associated with depression; however, this relationship has not been confirmed among Hispanic Americans. Hierarchical linear regression demonstrated that Excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly related to depression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that the Epworth Sleepiness Scale discriminated with adequate sensitivity and specificity between participants with moderately severe depression and those with less severe symptoms. No sociodemographic variables moderated the Excessive daytime sleepiness-depression relationship. These findings suggest that depression should be considered when Hispanic Americans present with Excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Oxycodone for neuropathic pain in adults. This is an update of an earlier review that considered both neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia (Issue 6, 2014), which has now been split into separate reviews for the two conditions. This review considers neuropathic pain only.Opioid drugs, including oxycodone, are commonly used to treat neuropathic pain, and are considered effective by some professionals. Most reviews have examined all opioids together. This review sought evidence specifically for oxycodone, at any dose, and by any route of administration. Separate reviews consider other opioids. The updated searches identified one additional published study, and one clinical trial registry report. We included five studies reporting on 687 participants; 637 had painful diabetic neuropathy and 50 had postherpetic neuralgia. Two studies used a cross-over design and three used a parallel group design; all studies used a placebo comparator, although one study used an active placebo (benztropine). Modified-release oxycodone (oxycodone MR) was titrated to effect and tolerability. One study used a fixed dose combination of oxycodone MR and naloxone. Two studies added oxycodone therapy to ongoing, stable treatment with either pregabalin or gabapentin. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias.No study reported the proportion of participants experiencing 'substantial benefit' (at least 50% pain relief or who were very much improved). Three studies (537 participants) in painful diabetic neuropathy reported outcomes equivalent to 'moderate benefit' (at least 30% pain relief or who were much or very much improved), which was experienced by 44% of participants with oxycodone and 27% with placebo (number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome (NNT) 5.7).All studies reported group mean pain scores at the end of treatment. Three studies reported a greater pain intensity reduction and better patient satisfaction with oxycodone MR alone than with placebo. There was a similar result in the study adding oxycodone MR to stable, ongoing gabapentin, but adding oxycodone MR plus naloxone to stable, ongoing pregabalin did not show any additional effect.More participants experienced adverse events with oxycodone MR alone (86%) than with placebo (63%); the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNH) was 4.3. Serious adverse events (oxycodone 3.4%, placebo 7.0%) and adverse event withdrawals (oxycodone 11%, placebo 6.4%) were not significantly different between groups. Withdrawals due to lack of efficacy were less frequent with oxycodone MR (1.1%) than placebo (11%), with a number needed to treat to prevent one withdrawal of 10. The add-on studies reported similar results.We downgraded the quality of the evidence to very low for all outcomes, due to limitations in the study methods, heterogeneity in the pain condition and study methods, and sparse data. There was only very low quality evidence that oxycodone (as oxycodone MR) is of value in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia. There was no evidence for other neuropathic pain conditions. Adverse events typical of opioids appeared to be common.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Long-term Safety of Asenapine in Pediatric Patients Diagnosed With Bipolar I Disorder: A 50-Week Open-Label, Flexible-Dose Trial. Sublingually administered asenapine was approved in March 2015 by the United States Food and Drug Administration for patients aged 10-17years with an acute manic or mixed episode associated with bipolar I disorder (BP-1). This is the first long-term safety and tolerability study of asenapine in this population. A total of 321 patients (lead-in study treatment: placebo, n=80; asenapine, n=241) were included; 267 (83.2%) reported one or more TEAE and 181 (56.4%) discontinued early, 48 (15.0%) due to TEAEs. Of the predefined TEAEs of interest, combined somnolence/sedation/hypersomnia occurred most frequently (42.4%) followed by oral hypoesthesia/dysgeusia (7.5%). In total, 109 (34.8%) patients experienced clinically significant weight gain (>=7% increase). No clinically meaningful changes were noted for laboratory parameters measured. Eighteen patients met the criteria for new-onset metabolic syndrome (MBS) post-baseline during the extension study, whereas 10 patients who met MBS criteria at baseline did not meet MBS criteria at endpoint. A total of 12 patients met MBS at baseline and endpoint. Mean change in YMRS total score from OLE baseline was -9.2 points at week 50, and change in CGI-BP severity overall score was similar among all treatment groups (those who initially received asenapine and those who initially received placebo). After 26weeks of treatment in the OLE, 79.2% of patients were classified as YMRS 50% responders relative to acute trial baseline. Asenapine was generally well tolerated in pediatric patients with BP-1 during <=50weeks of open-label treatment; among predefined TEAEs of interest, the combination of somnolence/sedation/hypersomnia was the most common.

      "Processing abstract: Predictors of daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The main symptomatic criterion to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) is the level of daytime sleepiness. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a simple, self-administered questionnaire which provides a measurement of the subject's general level of daytime sleepiness. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that can predict daytime sleepiness in patients with sleep apnea. The mean age of the subjects was 54.7 +/- 12.8 years, 82% males. The mean BMI was 31.9 +/- 6 kg/m2. Pearson correlation coefficient analysis demonstrates a significant positive correlation between the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and the desaturation index (r = 0.31, p < 0.01) and arterial hypertension (r = 0.32, p < 0.01). The forward stepwise regression analysis shows that the apnea hypopnea index and desaturation index are important predictors of daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea which explains 40% of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. The desaturation index showed the strongest correlation with the Epworth scale. According to the results of the backward stepwise multiple regression and logistic regression, the predictors for the level of daytime sleepiness are oAHI and index of desaturation. According to the analysis of the ROC curve, desaturation index is a predictor of a high specificity.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Associations among sleep disturbances, nocturnal sleep duration, daytime napping, and incident prediabetes and type 2 diabetes: the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study.  In adjusted regression models, short (<=5 hours) and long (>=7.5 hours) sleepers were at greater risk for diabetes (relative risk [RR]=1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.02-2.39, and 1.40, 95% CI=1.01-1.96, respectively [reference: 7 hours]). Moreover, the prevalence of any regular sleep disorder was associated with incident diabetes (RR=1.30, 95% CI=1.01-1.68), and with incident prediabetes (RR=1.31, 95% CI=1.00-1.72). Regular daytime nappers had no increased risk of incident diabetes (RR=1.00, 95% CI=0.70-1.41). This study shows that people with regular sleep disorders, people with short and long sleep duration, but not regular daytime nappers are at increased risk of diabetes. Furthermore, regular sleep disorders are associated with an increased risk of prediabetes.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Percheron artery infarction with or without midbrain involvement: A case series. Bilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions (Bilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions) due to artery of Percheron occlusion are known to cause hypersomnia. However, the role of hypocretin-1, a wake-promoting peptide that is located at the lateral hypothalamus, in hypersomnia in these patients remains unclear. CSF hypocretin-1 levels were decreased in 2 patients with BPT+RMI and were within normal ranges in 4 patients with BPT-MI. Hypersomnia was noted in all the patients. In one BPT+RMI patient, hypersomnia was improved within 2 weeks and decreased CSF hypocretin-1 levels were reversed (acute phase (on day 9), 109.2pg/mL; chronic phase (at 3 months), 323pg/mL), whereas another BPT+RMI patient who displayed coma in the acute phase had decreased CSF orexin levels (107pg/mL) at day 49 and exhibited severe disability. Hypocretin deficiency was not involved in hypersomnia observed in BPT-MI patients; however, CSF hypocretin-1 levels were reduced in BPT+RMI patients. Reduced CSF hypocretin-1 levels in the chronic phase may possibly predict a poor clinical outcome in patients with Percheron artery infarction.\n",

Patients with narcolepsy type 1 differed significantly from all the other patient groups, the latter, in turn, were not different between each other. The individual probability of the R-to-N2 transition was found to be the parameter showing the difference of highest significance between the groups (lowest in narcolepsy type 1) and classified patients with or without narcolepsy type 1 with an accuracy of 78.9% (sensitivity 78.5% and specificity 79.2%), by applying a cut-off value of 0.15. The main result of this study is that the structure of the sleep stage transition pattern of hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy type 1 patients is significantly different from that of other forms of central disorders of hypersomnolence and subjective hypersomnolence, with normal hypocretin levels.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Clinical features in patients with positional obstructive sleep apnea according to its subtypes.  The prevalence of positional obstructive sleep apnea was 75.6% with 39.9% having apnea-hypopnea index normalized <5/h while in non-supine position. Positional obstructive sleep apnea patients had milder obstructive sleep apnea, older age, and lower BMI than did non-positional obstructive sleep apnea patients. However, having positional obstructive sleep apnea did not influence daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Unlike the subtype I and II positional obstructive sleep apneas, subtype III did not differ in clinical features from non-positional obstructive sleep apnea. There were significant differences in supine sleep time depending on the positional tendency of obstructive sleep apnea. Subtype III positional obstructive sleep apnea had the shortest supine sleep time whereas subtype I positional obstructive sleep apnea and non-positional obstructive sleep apnea had the longest supine sleep time. Positional obstructive sleep apnea subtypes have different clinical characteristics. Subtyping of positional obstructive sleep apnea is helpful for developing specific treatment strategies according to positional tendency.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep quality and daytime sleepiness in patients with COPD and asthma. Nocturnal symptoms are common and important in both asthma and COPD but the relationship between sleep quality and diseases' characteristics has not been fully studied. Study included 117 patients with asthma, 100 patients with COPD, and 102 healthy controls. There was no difference in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale between patients with asthma and COPD (4.9+/-3.9 vs 5.8+/-4.3, P=.09 and 4.8+/-3.4 vs 4.7+/-3.6, P=.69, respectively). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale did not correlate with lung function parameters. Patients with uncontrolled asthma had higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (uncontrolled 7.0+/-3.7 vs partially controlled 4.6+/-3.1 vs controlled 3.2+/-3.7, P<.001). Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores were higher in COPD group D and B compared to A and C (group D 6.9 +/-4.6 vs B 6.8+/-4.1 vs A 2.9+/-1.3 vs C 3.1+/-3.9, P<.001). Compared to asthma, COPD patients had longer sleep latency and used sleep regulating medications more often. There is no difference in sleep quality and level of daytime sleepiness between patients with asthma and COPD. Poor sleep quality is related to level of asthma control and is associated with COPD groups B and D.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Impact of sleep quality on the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease: a questionnaire based study.  Fifty patients had poor sleep quality. excessive daytime somnolence was present in only 9 patients. Co-morbid depression and anxiety were present in 52 and 34 patients respectively. While the motor severity assessed by UParkinson's diseaseRS-III was observed to adversely affect quality of life, it did not negatively impact quality of sleep. Higher score on UParkinson's diseaseRS-total and UParkinson's diseaseRS IV suggesting advanced disease correlated with poor sleep quality. Depression and anxiety were significantly more frequent in patients with poor sleep quality (p<0.01). Patients with poor sleep quality had worse quality of life (r=0.338, p<0.05). Depression and anxiety were also observed to have significant negative impact on quality of life of Parkinson's disease patients (p<0.01). Poor sleep quality was not found to be an independent predictor of quality of life using multiple linear regression analysis. Poor sleep quality along with comorbid depression, anxiety and advanced stage of disease is associated with poor quality of life.\n",

Kleine-Levin syndrome (Kleine-Levin syndrome) is a rare sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia. Polysomnographic (Polysomnographic) researches of Kleine-Levin syndrome have been reported only in few publications in the past decades. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of Polysomnographic of Kleine-Levin syndrome. Five of the seven patients were males. The mean age at Kleine-Levin syndrome onset was 15.6 +/- 3.6 years. The number of episodes ranged from 2 to 7. The duration of episodes lasted from 4 to 11 days. The sleep architecture and proportion were normal in most of the patients. The average value of mean sleep latency was 6.9 +/- 4.1 min. No sleep-onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) was detected in three of the patients, whereas one patient experienced one period of SOREM, and such episodes occurred twice in other two patients. We found that sleep architecture and proportion were normal in most Kleine-Levin syndrome patients. However, the results of Polysomnographic and MSLT had no specificity for Kleine-Levin syndrome patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Excessive daytime sleepiness is associated with an exacerbation of migraine: A population-based study. Previous studies have shown that migraine and sleep disturbances are closely associated. Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) is a common symptom of various types of sleep disturbance. Findings from clinic-based studies suggest that a high percentage of migraineurs experience Excessive daytime sleepiness. However, the prevalence and clinical impact of Excessive daytime sleepiness among migraineurs at the population level have rarely been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence and impact of Excessive daytime sleepiness among migraineurs using a population-based sample in Korea. Of the 2,695 participants that completed the interview, 143 (5.3%) and 313 (11.6%) were classified as having migraine and Excessive daytime sleepiness, respectively. The prevalence of Excessive daytime sleepiness was significantly higher in participants with migraine (19.6%) and non-migraine headache (13.4%) compared to non-headache controls (9.4%). Migraineurs with Excessive daytime sleepiness had higher scores on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for headache intensity (6.9+/-1.8 vs. 6.0+/-1.9, p=0.014) and Headache Impact Test-6 (59.8+/-10.2 vs. 52.5+/-8.2, p<0.001) compared to migraineurs without Excessive daytime sleepiness. Approximately 20% of migraineurs had Excessive daytime sleepiness in this population-based sample. Excessive daytime sleepiness was associated with an exacerbation of some migraine symptoms.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Self-Reported Napping Behavior Change After Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment in Older Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.  continuous positive airway pressure treatment duration was 82.7 +/- 30.0 weeks, and objective adherence was 5.4 +/- 2.0 hours per night overall. Daytime nap frequency before continuous positive airway pressure treatment was higher in those with a history of stroke or cardiovascular disease. Both sexes had a significant reduction in daytime napping (men, P < .001; women, P = .008), evening napping (men, P < .001; women, P = .02), and daily nap duration (men, P < .001; women, P = .02). Logistic regression analysis showed that the reduction in self-reported daily nap duration was associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.86, P = .04), a decrease in ESS score (OR = 1.20, P = .03), and longer self-reported daily nap duration at baseline (OR = 31.52, P < .001). Long-term continuous positive airway pressure treatment in older adults with obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome can play a significant role in reducing nap frequency and daily nap duration. Aging or shorter baseline daily nap duration may attenuate this effect.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Opioids for restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome (Restless legs syndrome) is a distressing and common neurological disorder that may have a huge impact in the quality of life of those with frequent and intense symptoms. Patients complain of unpleasant sensations in the legs, at or before bedtime, and feel an urge to move the legs, which improves with movement, such as walking. Symptoms start with the patient at rest (e.g. sitting or lying down), and follow a circadian pattern, increasing during the evening or at night. Many pharmacological intervention are available for Restless legs syndrome, including drugs used to treat Parkinson's disease (L-Dopa and dopaminergic agonists), epilepsy (anticonvulsants), anxiety (benzodiazepines), and pain (opioids). Dopaminergic drugs are those most frequently used for treatment of Restless legs syndrome, but some patients do not respond effectively and require other medication. Opioids, a class of medications used to treat severe pain, seem to be effective in treating Restless legs syndrome symptoms, and are recommended for patients with severe symptoms, because Restless legs syndrome and pain appear to share the same mechanism in the central nervous system. All available drugs are associated to some degree with side effects, which can impede treatment. Opioids are associated with adverse events such as constipation, tolerance, and dependence. This justifies the conduct of a systematic review to ascertain whether opioids are safe and effective for treatment of Restless legs syndrome. We included one randomised clinical trial (N = 304 randomised; 204 completed; 276 analysed) that evaluated opioids (prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone) versus placebo. After 12 weeks, RSL symptoms had improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRestless legs syndromeSS: MD -7.0; 95% CI -9.69 to -4.31 and the CGI: MD -1.11; 95% CI -1.49 to -0.73). More patients in the drug group than in the placebo group were drug responders (using the IRestless legs syndromeSS: RR 1.82; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.42 and the CGI: RR1.92; 95% ICI 1.49 to 2.48). The proportion of remitters was greater in the drug group than in the placebo group (using the IRestless legs syndromeSS: RR 2.14; 95% CI 1.45 to 3.16). Quality of life scores also improved more in the drug group than in the placebo group (MD -0.73; 95% CI -1.1 to -0.36). Quality of sleep was improved more in the drug group measured by sleep adequacy (MD -0.74; 95% CI -1.15 to -0.33), and sleep quantity (MD 0.89; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26).There was no difference between groups for daytime somnolence, trouble staying awake during the day, or naps during the day. More adverse events were reported in the drug group (RR 1.22; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.39). The major adverse events were gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and headache. Opioids seem to be effective for treating Restless legs syndrome symptoms, but there are no definitive data regarding the important problem of safety. This conclusion is based on only one study with a high dropout rate (moderate quality evidence).\n",
      "Processing abstract: Nocturia, Other Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Sleep Dysfunction in a Community-Dwelling Cohort of Men.  Men with nocturia were found to have higher levels of obstructive sleep apnea (32.2% [n=65]), wake after sleep onset time (97.2+/-52.9 minutes), sleep period (467.3+/-58.4 minutes), excessive daytime sleepiness (18.2% [n=37]), and poorer sleep quality (54.3% [n=108]). Multiple-adjusted models showed nocturia was positively associated with obstructive sleep apnea (odds ratio:1.64, 95% confidence interval [1.03,2.55]), excessive daytime sleepiness (1.72 [1.01,2.93]), and poorer sleep quality (1.65 [1.10,2.48]). Including other storage and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms attenuated the effect of obstructive sleep apnea and strengthened the association with excessive daytime sleepiness (2.44 [1.45,4.10] and 2.24 [1.19,4.22]), whereas voiding lower urinary tract symptoms also strengthened the association with poorer sleep quality (2.61 [1.63,4.17]). Men with increasing nocturic frequency spent less time in N2 and rapid eye movement stage sleep. Nocturia is strongly associated with obstructive sleep apnea in community-based men. Nocturia also reduces sleep efficiency/sleep quality, N2, and rapid eye movement sleep time, while increasing excessive daytime sleepiness. Other lower urinary tract symptoms increase excessive daytime sleepiness through non-obstructive sleep apnea means.\n",

Reactive hyperemia index (Reactive hyperemia index) was also significantly lower in the obstructive sleep apnea group (1.55+/-0.27 vs. 2.01+/-0.48, p=0.0007). carotid intima media thickness was observed to be significantly higher in the obstructive sleep apnea group compared to the non-obstructive sleep apnea group (0.54+/-0.09 vs. 0.48+/-0.08mm; p=0.049). In the obstructive sleep apnea group, flow-mediated dilatation, Reactive hyperemia index, and carotid intima media thickness did not show a significant correlation with obstructive sleep apnea disease severity indices [apnea hypopnea index (apnea hypopnea index), oxygen desaturation index (oxygen desaturation index), and minimum O<sub>2</sub> saturation]. Endothelial function in macrovascular and microvascular circulation is significantly impaired in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea patients without comorbidities. These patients also show evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis, in the form of increased carotid intima media thickness.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Misdiagnosis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic primary sleep disorder, characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep dysfunction with or without cataplexy. Narcolepsy is uncommon, with a low prevalence rate which makes it difficult to diagnose definitively without a complex series of tests and a detailed history. The aim of this study was to review patients referred to a tertiary sleep centre who had been labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy prior to referral in order to assess if the diagnosis was accurate, and if not, to determine the cause of diagnostic misattribution. Of the 41 directly referred patients with a diagnostic label of narcolepsy, 19 (46%) were subsequently confirmed to have narcolepsy on objective testing and assessment by a sleep physician using ICSD-2 criteria. The diagnosis of narcolepsy was incorrectly attributed to almost 50% of patients labelled with a diagnosis of narcolepsy who were referred for further opinion by a variety of specialists and generalists. Accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy is critical for many reasons, such as the impact it has on quality of life, driving, employment, insurance and pregnancy in women as well as medication management.\n",

The percentage of responders for high-frequency napping, four or more days per week, was 21.2% among men and 17.1% among women. The percentage of responders for long-duration napping, 2h or more per one nap, was 2.9% among men and 2.6% among women. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that men, older age, smoking, insomnia symptoms, long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and having sufficient rest obtained by sleep were positively associated with high-frequency napping, whereas alcohol drinking showed a negative association. Older age was negatively associated with long-duration napping whereas living in a large community, smoking, long sleep duration, excessive daytime sleepiness, and psychological stress showed a positive association. These findings provide important data for future studies aimed at improvement of sleep habits.\n",

Sleep continuity was measured with daily sleep diaries assessing sleep latency (sleep latency), wake after sleep onset (wake after sleep onset), and total sleep time (total sleep time). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) measured daytime sleepiness. Compared to the PLA group, the cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia+P and cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia+A groups reported a significant reduction in sleep latency with effect sizes of 0.67 and 0.58, respectively. A significant reduction was observed in wake after sleep onset in the cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia+A group with an effect size of 0.64. An increasing trend of total sleep time was observed in the cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia+P, cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia+A, and PLA groups, but not in the ARM group. No statistically significant reductions in daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) were observed for any of the groups. cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia alone and in combination with armodafinil caused significant improvement in sleep continuity. The addition of armodafinil did not appear to improve daytime sleepiness or enhance adherence to cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia.\n",

Thirty-three children with epilepsy (21 males, 12 females) were studied (median age [interquartile range {IQR}] 9y [5-12]), along with 42 comparison children (20 males, 22 females; median age [IQR] 6y [4-8.5]). Fifty-five per cent of children with epilepsy scored 0.33 or higher on the PSQ-SRBD compared with 7% in the comparison group (p<0.001), and 30% of children with epilepsy had an abnormal Epworth Sleepiness Scale compared with 5% controls (p=0.003). Within the children with epilepsy cohort, PSQ-SRDB and Epworth Sleepiness Scale appeared higher in those taking antiepileptic drugs (antiepileptic drugs); although PSQ-SRBD score for children with epilepsy not on antiepileptic drugs was higher than in the comparison group. This study suggests higher rates of symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea and excessive daytime sleepiness in children with epilepsy compared with typically developing children. antiepileptic drugs may be a confounding factor, but do not alone account for the associations seen. Further studies including polysomnography to verify the presence (rather than suggestion by questionnaire) of obstructive sleep apnoea are warranted.\n",

Patients with fasting plasma glucose (FPG >=13.1 mmol/l) were identified as the group with a higher risk associated with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale>10 (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8-7.9, p = 0.0003). A stepwise regression analyses showed that the presence of T2D, baseline glucose levels and gender but not polysomnographic parameters (i.e apnea-hyoapnea index or sleeping time spent with oxigen saturation lower than 90%) independently predicted the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. In addition, subjects with T2D showed higher sleep disturbances [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: 7.0 (1.0-18.0) vs. 4 (0.0-12.0), p<0.001].

Mean partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were higher than patient-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (12.3+/-4.2 vs. 9.4+/-4.8, p<0.0001); Bland-Altman plot showed significant bias (partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores 33.5% higher, SD +/-55.2%). Partner-completed and combined (but not patient-completed) Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores correlated weakly with the apnea-hypopnea index (apnea-hypopnea index; partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale score r <sub>s</sub> =0.25, p=0.029; combined Epworth Sleepiness Scale score r <sub>s</sub> =0.29, p=0.013) and oxygen desaturation index (partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale score r <sub>s</sub> =0.26, p=0.025; combined Epworth Sleepiness Scale score r <sub>s</sub> =0.23, p=0.047). None of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores correlated with body mass index, arousal index, or other parameters of nocturnal oxygen desaturation. In obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index>15/h) detection, partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores had greater sensitivity than patient-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (76.9 vs. 46.2%) but poorer specificity (39.1 vs. 65.2%); sensitivity was greatest (82.7%) when either patient-completed or partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 10 or higher, and specificity was greatest (80.8%) when both scores were 10 or higher. Neither patient-completed nor partner-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores by themselves have great utility in identifying obstructive sleep apnea or predicting its severity. However, taking both scores into consideration together improves the sensitivity and specificity of the screening process.\n",

Median age at diagnosis was 17 years (range: 12-19), 71.4% of them were men, and mean diagnosis delay after the first episode was 20.1 +/- 10.9 months. We identified 9 mimic patients referred to our center; they differed from Kleine-Levin syndrome patients by their higher age at disease onset (median: 15 [range: 12-16] vs. 19 [range: 16-64] years; p < 0.001), suspected Kleine-Levin syndrome as referral reason (more frequent in mimics, p = 0.003), and the presence of precipitating factors (more frequent in Kleine-Levin syndrome, p = 0.011). Among the mimic patients, 77% (versus 28% in Kleine-Levin syndrome) had a psychiatric diagnosis. This study suggests a relatively higher Kleine-Levin syndrome prevalence than previously reported.

Although dopamine agonists (dopamine agonists) are useful in Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease), they are not frequently used in elderly patients due to adverse effects. However, there is a lack of evidence because few elderly Parkinson's disease patients are enrolled in clinical trials. The DA withdrawal percentage was 18.2% (12/66; follow-up of 690.2+/-232.6days). DA withdrawal causes were cognitive impairment (3), reduction therapy (3), hallucinations (2), dyskinesia (2), and excessive diurnal somnolence (2). Only a higher levodopa daily dose (HR 1.003; 95% CI 1.001-1.006; P=0.044) was an independent predictor of DA withdrawal after adjustment for other explanatory variables. The frequency of DA withdrawal was low. Advanced age alone is not a contraindication to the administration of dopamine agonists.\n",

On the screening questionnaire, 17 patients had an ESS score >=11 without cataplexy, 15 had cataplexy-like symptoms with an ESS score<11, and four had an ESS score >=11 plus cataplexy-like symptoms. Of those, 24 patients were evaluated by a sleep specialist. Five of these 24 were HLA DQB1*06:02 positive, and three of these five subjects underwent lumbar puncture showing normal hypocretin-1 levels.

The primary goal of this study was to accurately obtain the rates of self-reported sleep disorders, sleep dysfunction, and daytime sleepiness in a true community sample of black adults. Sleep disorders (insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea) were found in 34% of the sample, and 75% of the population that had a sleep disorder was unaware of it. Fourteen percent of the sample self-identified as having obstructive sleep apnea, 38.0% reported having Insomnia, and 38% reported having excessive daytime somnolence. People with a sleep disorder described less satisfaction with their sleep quality and poorer health than did those without a sleep disorder. The variability in the reported rates of sleep disorders in black samples suggests that the true rates of these conditions are not well-known. However, the large number of black individuals who have sleep disturbances warrants increased scientific and public health attention. In addition, with increased community involvement in research, there can be increased buy-in and greater accuracy in the assessments and reduced barriers to treatment.\n",

Emotional profile in patients with NT1 positively correlated with age at onset, diagnostic delay, and subjective sleepiness, whereas treatment and disease duration were associated with fewer behavioral problems (attention problems, aggressive behavior, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Psychosocial health domains of pediatric NT1 were worse than in healthy controls, whereas the physical health domains were comparable. Young NT1 patients show a discrete pattern of altered behavioral, thought, and mood profile in comparison with healthy controls and with idiopathic epilepsy patients thus suggesting a direct link with sleepiness. Further studies investigating behavior in patients with idiopathic hypersomnia or type 2 narcolepsy are needed to disentangle the role of REM sleep dysfunction and hypocretin deficiency in psychiatric disorders. Symptoms of withdrawal, depression, somatic complaints, thought problems, and aggressiveness were common, NT1 children perceived lower school competencies than healthy children, and their parents also reported worse psychosocial health.

      "Processing abstract: Pharmacological treatment for Kleine-Levin syndrome. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review, published in 2009, Issue 2.Kleine-Levin syndrome (KLS) is a rare disorder that mainly affects adolescent men. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia, usually accompanied by hyperphagia, cognitive and mood disturbances, abnormal behaviour, such as hypersexuality, and signs of dysautonomia.In 1990, the diagnostic criteria for Kleine-Levin syndrome were modified in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, where KLS was defined as a syndrome comprised of recurring episodes of undue sleepiness lasting some days, which may or may not be associated with hyperphagia and abnormal behaviour. According to the International Classification of Sleepiness Disorders, 3rd version (International Classification of Sleepiness Disorders, 3rd version), revised in 2014, the Kleine-Levin syndrome is a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia that last from two days to four weeks, with at least annual recurrence, and hyperphagia (rapid consumption of a large amount of food), usually with onset in early adolescence in males but occasionally in later life and in women. A monosymptomatic form of the disorder with hypersomnia only can occur without binge eating or hypersexuality.The cause of Kleine-Levin syndrome remains unknown, and several treatment strategies have been used.

      "Processing abstract: Prevalence of Risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome and Association With Risk Factors in Primary Care. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome) is a chronic, progressive disease with high morbidity and mortality. It is underdiagnosed, especially among women. Of the total (616), 403 individuals (65.4%) reported snoring. The prevalence of high risk for OSA was 42.4%, being 49.7% for category I, 10.2% for category II and 77.6% for category III. Berlin Questionnaire showed an acceptable reliability after excluding the questions Has anyone noticed that you stop breathing during your sleep? and Have you ever dozed off or fallen asleep while driving?. This should be tested in further studies with samples mostly comprised of women and low educational level individuals. Given the burden of Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome-related diseases and risks, studies should be conducted to validate new tools and to adapt Berlin Questionnaire to better screen Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.\n",

      "Processing abstract: A protocol for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression: Item scoring rules, Rater training, and outcome accuracy with data on its application in a clinical trial. We present a fully articulated protocol for the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), including item scoring rules, rater training procedures, and a data management algorithm to increase accuracy of scores prior to outcome analyses. The latter involves identifying potentially inaccurate scores as interviews with discrepancies between two independent raters on the basis of either scores >=5-point difference) or meeting threshold for depression recurrence status, a long-term treatment outcome with public health significance. Discrepancies are resolved by assigning two new raters, identifying items with disagreement per an algorithm, and reaching consensus on the most accurate scores for those items. Inter-rater reliability ranged from ICCs of .923-.967. Only 86 (5.6%) interviews met criteria for a between-rater discrepancy. HAM-D items \"Depressed Mood\", \"Work and Activities\", \"Middle Insomnia\", and \"Hypochondriasis\" and Atypical items \"Fatigability\" and \"Hypersomnia\" contributed most to discrepancies. Generalizability beyond well-trained, experienced raters in a clinical trial is unknown.\n",

In total, 72 narcolepsy cases and 251 controls were included (range 3-69 years mean19-years). Risk of narcolepsy was increased in individuals with a disease history of nervous system disorders (OR range = 3.6-8.8) and mental and behavioural disorders (OR = 3.8, 95% CI 1.6-8.8) before referral. In a second analysis of vaccinated individuals only, nearly all initial associations were no longer statistically significant and effect sizes were smaller (OR range = 1.3-2.6). A significant effect for antibiotics (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) and a marginally significant effect for nervous system disorders was observed. In a third case-only analysis, comparing cases referred before vaccination to those referred after; prescriptions for nervous system disorders (OR = 26.0 95% CI 4.0-170.2) and ADHD (OR = 35.3 95% CI 3.4-369.9) were statistically significant during the vaccination period, suggesting initial associations were due to confounding by indication. The findings of this study do not support disease history before A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination as a risk factor for narcolepsy.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Effects of gamma-Aminobutyric Acid Type A Receptor Modulation by Flumazenil on Emergence from General Anesthesia. Transitions into conscious states are partially mediated by inactivation of sleep networks and activation of arousal networks. Pharmacologic hastening of emergence from general anesthesia has largely focused on activating subcortical monoaminergic networks, with little attention on antagonizing the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor). As the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor mediates the clinical effects of many common general anesthetics, the authors hypothesized that negative gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor modulators would hasten emergence, possibly via cortical networks involved in sleep. Animals administered intravenous flumazenil (0.4mg/kg, n = 8) exhibited hastened emergence compared to saline-treated animals (n = 8) at cessation of isoflurane anesthesia. Wake-like electroencephalographic patterns occurred sooner and exhibited more high-frequency electroencephalography power after flumazenil administration (median latency +/- median absolute deviation: 290+/-34s) compared to saline administration (473+/-186s; P = 0.042). Moreover, in flumazenil-treated animals, there was a decreased impact on postanesthesia sleep. In vitro experiments in human embryonic kidney-293T cells demonstrated that flumazenil inhibited isoflurane-mediated GABA current enhancement (n = 34 cells, 88.7+/-2.42% potentiation at 3 muM). Moreover, flumazenil exhibited weak agonist activity on the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (n = 10 cells, 10.3+/-3.96% peak GABA EC20 current at 1 muM). Flumazenil can modulate emergence from isoflurane anesthesia. The authors highlight the complex role gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors play in mediating consciousness and provide mechanistic links between emergence from anesthesia and arousal.\n",

In 327 antipsychotic-naive youth originally initiating the four studied SGAs, discontinuation due to sedation was marginally highest with quetiapine (13.0%) followed by olanzapine (7.3%), risperidone (4.2%), and aripiprazole (2.0%) (p=0.056). Two hundred fifty-seven antipsychotic-naive youth (13.8+/-3.6 years, male=57.8%) initiated aripiprazole (n=40), olanzapine (n=45), quetiapine (n=36), or risperidone (n=135) and completed >=1 postbaseline follow-up visit. Baseline prevalence of ACTIVATION+ (39.9%) or SEDATION+ (54.1%) did not differ between SGAs. Rates of both compound measures changed significantly over time (decrease for ACTIVATION+, p=0.0002; increase for SEDATION+, p<0.0001) with slight differences between SGAs, explained by lower rates of ACTIVATION+ with olanzapine (p=0.002) and slightly higher rates of ACTIVATION+ with aripiprazole (p=0.018) during follow-up, and lower rates of SEDATION+ with aripiprazole (p=0.018). All four SGAs reduced insomnia (p=0.001) and increased hypersomnia (p<0.001). Postbaseline prevalence of drowsiness, the most frequent, but mild Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale complaint was 85%, without SGA differences. Younger age was associated with activating symptoms, higher age with sedating symptoms, and lower baseline functioning increased both. Psychomotor retardation rates were high in subjects with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, whereas stimulant comedication was associated with psychomotor activation, regardless of diagnosis. Although small SGA-specific differences in activating/sedating compound side effect measures were noted, independent predictors of single Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale ratings included clinical parameters, rather than specific SGAs, suggesting a need for carefully individualized treatment strategies.\n",

Linear regression analysis showed that higher Sleep Breathing Scale (P = 0.005) and Beck Depression Inventory scores (P < 0.001) were associated with higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale score after controlling for gender, body mass index and apnoea-hypopnoea index. Apnoea-hypopnoea index, MinSaO2 and body mass index were not independently related to Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Daytime sleepiness was related to subjective obstructive sleep apnoea symptoms but not objective apnoea severity measured by polysomnography in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnoea. These findings suggest the usefulness of the subjective apnoea severity as an indicator of obstructive sleep apnoea disease severity.\n",

Objectively, recorded snoring was more common among the pregnant women (median 9% of total estimated sleep time) than among the controls (4% of total sleep time, p=0.005). Three of the pregnant women had obstructive sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) >5), but in two cases, this was mainly due to central hypopneas. None had AHI >10. Two controls were diagnosed as obstructive sleep apnea. Respiratory parameters including snoring showed no impact on obstetric outcomes. Total Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score was higher among pregnant women than among controls (median 9 vs 7, p<0.001). There was no difference concerning the separate items. There were no significant associations between either subjectively reported or objectively recorded snoring and ESS scores. There was no increased prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea among pregnant women. One reason for this could be that the majority of the women in this study were non-obese. Neither obstructive sleep apnea nor snoring was likely an explanation for the increased daytime sleepiness seen in the pregnant women.\n",

However, the impact of parental sleeping problems on parental perceptions and reports of their child's sleep has not yet been studied. We hypothesized that poor parental sleep decreases the parent-reported child sleep quality. Parental sleeping problems were associated with more frequent reporting of children's sleeping problems. This association was unexplained by the actigraph measures of children's sleep, such as actual 24-hour sleep time and sleep efficiency, parental mental health problems, or any other tested potential confounder or mediator. Similar correlations were seen for the 3 analyzed subscales. Parental sleep quality was associated with overreporting of sleep problems in their children.

Four trials addressed interventions for excessive daytime sleepiness. Meta-analysis of the three trials evaluating modafinil showed a significant reduction in sleepiness, as assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) (- 2.24 points, 95% CI - 3.90 to - 0.57, p<0.05). In one study, treatment with caffeine was associated with a non-significant improvement of 1.71 points in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (95% CI, - 3.57 to 0.13). The six remaining trials assessed interventions for insomnia and REM sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD). Single study results suggest that doxepin and YXQN granules might be efficacious, while pergolide may be deleterious for insomnia and that rivastigmine may be used to treat RBD in Parkinson's disease patients. However, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any of these interventions. No relevant side effects were reported. Whilst providing recommendations, this systematic review depicts the lack of a body of evidence regarding the treatment of sleep disorders in Parkinson's disease patients; hence, further studies are warranted.\n",

The objective of this study was to assess the somnolence effect of cetirizine 10 mg daily compared to placebo in patients aged 6 years and older using meta-analysis and explore the sources of heterogeneity among different studies. Various analyses showed that heterogeneity existed among the 13 trials and the placebo run-in period was the cause of heterogeneity.

Almost half (46.8%) of the 158 adult patients with sleepwalking or sleep terrors reported excessive daytime sleepiness. They had shorter sleep onset latencies (in night 1 and night 2), shorter REM sleep latencies, longer total sleep time, and higher REM sleep percentages in night 2, but no greater clinical severity of the parasomnia than patients without sleepiness. The level of sleepiness correlated with the same measures (sleep onset latency on both nights, REM sleep onset latency, and total sleep time in night 2), plus the latency to N3. In the regression model, higher sleepiness was determined by shorter sleep onset latency on night 1, lower number of awakenings in N3 on night 1, and higher total sleep time on night 2. Daytime sleepiness in patients with sleepwalking or sleep terrors is not the consequence of disturbed sleep but is associated with a specific polygraphic phenotype (rapid sleep onset, long sleep time, lower numbers of awakenings on N3) that is suggestive of a higher sleep pressure that may contribute to incomplete arousal from N3.\n",

An increase in narcolepsy cases was observed in Finland and Sweden towards the end of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Preliminary observational studies suggested a temporal link with the pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix(TM), leading to a number of additional studies across Europe. Given the public health urgency, these studies used readily available retrospective data from various sources. The potential for bias in such settings was generally acknowledged. Although generally advocated by key opinion leaders and international health authorities, no systematic quantitative assessment of the potential joint impact of biases was undertaken in any of these studies. Given the assumptions used for confounding, selection bias and misclassification, the Finnish rate ratio of 13.78 (95% CI: 5.72-28.11) reduced to a median value of 6.06 (2.5th- 97.5th percentile: 2.49-15.1) and the French odds ratio of 5.43 (95% CI: 2.6-10.08) to 1.85 (2.5th-97.5th percentile: 0.85-4.08).

      "Processing abstract: Idiopathic Hypersomnia and Hypersomnolence Disorder: A Systematic Review of the Literature. Hypersomnia is a common complaint in medical offices. Often patients are given psychiatric diagnoses, but a primary sleep disorder may be present. The new diagnosis of \"hypersomnolence disorder\" (hypersomnolence disorder\") in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition is a primary sleep disorder most similar to the diagnosis \"idiopathic hypersomnia\" (idiopathic hypersomnia\") in sleep literature and can be missed in psychiatric settings. A total of 143 articles discussed idiopathic hypersomnia\", whereas no articles were found regarding hypersomnolence disorder\". Most articles were review articles, prospective studies, or studies of pathophysiology. idiopathic hypersomnia\" is found in approximately 0.02%-0.010% of the general population, has a mean age of onset of 21.8 years, and is associated with several somatic symptoms. Alterations in histaminergic or dopaminergic signaling may be involved in idiopathic hypersomnia\". Treatment with modafinil or other stimulants appears moderately effective. idiopathic hypersomnia\" can be differentiated from psychiatric hypersomnolence by formal polysomnography. idiopathic hypersomnia\" and hypersomnolence disorder\" are relatively uncommon disorders and little is known about them. However, they are distinct from psychiatric disorders and respond well to treatment once properly identified.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Subjective and Objective Measures of Hypersomnolence Demonstrate Divergent Associations with Depression among Participants in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study.  After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, chronic medical conditions, sedative hypnotic medication use, caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol use, sleep disordered breathing, as well as insomnia and sleep duration when appropriate, estimated odd ratios (95% confidence interval) for depression were: 1.56 (1.31,1.86) for ESS >= 11; 2.01 (1.49, 2.72) for habitual sleep time >= 9 h; and 0.76 (0.63-0.92) for multiple sleep latency test mean sleep latency < 8 min. Our results demonstrate divergent associations between subjective and objective symptoms of hypersomnolence and depression, with subjective sleepiness and excessive sleep duration associated with increased odds of depression, but objective sleep propensity as measured by the multiple sleep latency test associated with decreased odds of depression. Further research is indicated to explain this paradox and the impact of different hypersomnolence measures on the course of mood disorders.\n",

A total of 2,749 polysomnography records were reviewed; 262 included multiple sleep latency test and 241 met inclusion criteria for the study. Of those, 152 patients were discharged immediately after the last multiple sleep latency test run, 89 on the following day. multiple sleep latency test mean sleep latency, and sleep latency of the last run only, did not differ between both groups (p = 0.070 and p = 0.065). In the subgroup of patients with pathological multiple sleep latency test, there was a trend towards prolonged sleep latency in the last run in patients discharged immediately after the test (p = 0.055). Our findings suggest that the multiple sleep latency test post-test factor of discharge timing has no major impact on the multiple sleep latency test outcome.\n",

Subjects with excessive daytime sleepiness tended to be male and of heavier body habitus. Although both genders exhibited similar snoring intensities, men had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores than women. A strong linear correlation was demonstrated between the maximal snoring intensity and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score. Maximal snoring sound and male gender were shown to be predictors of excessive daytime sleepiness, with odds ratios of 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]:1.63-2.26, P<.001) and 3.70 (95% CI: 1.29-12.5, P=.01), respectively. In a population of non-obstructive sleep apnea subjects referred to a polysomnography study, snoring intensity was associated with excessive daytime sleepiness in both men and women. A positive linear correlation was observed between snoring intensities and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores.

Few stimulants have been evaluated for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia (idiopathic hypersomnia). Sodium oxybate (indicated in narcolepsy type 1, NT1) has not been tested in idiopathic hypersomnia patients. Sodium oxybate was prescribed at a lower dose in idiopathic hypersomnia than in NT1 (4.3+/-2.2 vs. 6.6+/-2.8g/night, p<0.0001) patients after having tried more (3.2+/-1.4 vs. 2.2+/-1, p<0.0001) stimulants, but it produced a similar Epworth sleepiness scale change (-3.5+/-4.5 vs. -3.2+/-4.2 points) in the idiopathic hypersomnia and NT1 groups. Severe morning inertia was improved in 24/34 (71%) patients with idiopathic hypersomnia. During the follow-up period (15.8 months in idiopathic hypersomnia vs. 35 months in NT1 groups), 53% idiopathic hypersomnia and 68% NT1 patients dropped out. The side effects were as frequent in the idiopathic hypersomnia group as in the NT1 group (67% vs. 52%), but nausea (40% vs. 13%) and dizziness (34.3% vs. 4.3%) were more frequent in the idiopathic hypersomnia group.

An association between obstructive sleep apnea and the incidence of heart failure has been reported in men but not in women. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a combination of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness, the two main symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, was able to predict incident heart failure in a population-based sample of women. Among women with both snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness at baseline, 5.3% developed heart failure during follow-up compared with 0.9% in the reference group with neither snoring nor excessive daytime sleepiness. After adjustment for age, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol, hypertension, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, physical inactivity, depressive symptoms, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy, women with the combination of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness had a twofold increase in the risk of incident heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 2.2 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-4.4).

Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) is a common feature of Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease) that contributes to the disease burden and increases risk of harm. The aim of this study was to examine persistency, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations, and risk factors for Excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with Parkinson's disease. Excessive daytime sleepiness proved a non-persistent symptom, although persistency and the proportion of patients with Excessive daytime sleepiness increased with longer follow-up. At baseline 43% of patients had Excessive daytime sleepiness, while 46% of patients without Excessive daytime sleepiness at baseline developed this symptom during follow-up. Male gender, poorer nighttime sleep, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction, hallucinations, less severe dyskinesias, dose of dopamine agonists and use of antihypertensives were associated with higher Excessive daytime sleepiness scores over time, while use of benzodiazepines was associated with lower scores. Baseline SCOPA-SLEEP-DS score and PIGD phenotype were risk factors for future Excessive daytime sleepiness. With longer disease duration a large proportion of patients develop Excessive daytime sleepiness. Some risk factors are modifiable and patients should be monitored to improve quality of life and reduce risk of harm.\n",

To examine the long-term efficacy and safety of duloxetine in the treatment of Japanese patients with diabetic neuropathic pain, we carried out a 52-week, randomized, open-label extension of a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Significant (P<0.0001) and sustained improvements (change+/-standard deviation; n=257) were observed in Brief Pain Inventory severity (average pain score -2.1+/-1.7). Improvements were also seen in Brief Pain Inventory interference (mean of subscores -0.96+/-1.52) and Patient's Global Impression of Improvement (-0.9+/-1.1) scores; these scores decreased significantly (P<0.0001) during the long-term study. Frequently reported adverse events included somnolence (13.6%), constipation (13.2%) and nausea (10.5%). Increases were observed in plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and total cholesterol levels, and in bodyweight and heart rate; however, none of these were clinically meaningful.

Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease), but its neuropathology remains elusive due to the limited studies and the inclusion of medicated patients. This current study examined the neural substrates of Excessive daytime sleepiness in drug naive Parkinson's disease patients. ReHo analysis controlling for gray matter volume, age, gender, general cognition, depression, postural instability gait difficulty, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder showed decreased ReHo in the left cerebellum and inferior frontal gyrus, but increased ReHo in the left paracentral lobule in Parkinson's disease-Excessive daytime sleepiness patients, compared with patients without Excessive daytime sleepiness. FC analysis controlling for the same variables as in the analysis of ReHo revealed that the three regions showing ReHo differences had decreased FC with regions in the frontal, temporal, insular and limbic lobes and cerebellum in Parkinson's diseases with Excessive daytime sleepiness. While decreases in ReHo and FC were found, increases in ReHo were also noted, implying both neural downregulation and compensatory mechanisms in early Parkinson's disease patients with Excessive daytime sleepiness. Longitudinal studies are warranted to clarify the long-term impact of Excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson's disease.\n",

We found significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 levels in the whole narcolepsy group with respect to controls. Taking into account the patient subgroups, we documented reduced cerebrospinal fluid assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 levels in SdN compared to both LdN and controls. Even LdN patients showed lower cerebrospinal fluid assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 levels with respect to controls. Moreover, we documented higher cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau levels in LdN patients compared to both SdN and controls. Finally, a significant positive correlation between cerebrospinal fluid assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid1-42 levels and disease duration was evident. We hypothesize that beta-amyloid metabolism and cascade may be impaired in narcolepsy not only at the onset but also along with the disease course, although they show a compensatory profile over time. Concurrently, also cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers indicative of neural structure (phosphorylated tau) appear to be altered in narcolepsy patients with a long disease duration. However, the mechanism underlying beta-amyloid and tau metabolism impairment in narcolepsy remains still unclear and deserves to be better elucidated.\n",

It did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A close relationship between plasma gamma-Hydroxybutyrate exposure and its psychotropic effects was found, with higher gamma-Hydroxybutyrate concentrations associated with higher subjective stimulation, sedation, and dizziness. No clockwise hysteresis was observed in the gamma-Hydroxybutyrate concentration effect plot over time (i.e., no acute pharmacological tolerance).

Theoretical models of Bipolar Disorder (Bipolar Disorder) highlight that sleep disturbances may be a marker of underlying circadian dysregulation. However, few studies of sleep in Bipolar Disorder have reported on the most prevalent circadian sleep abnormality, namely Delayed Sleep Phase (Delayed Sleep Phase). About 10% of Bipolar Disorder cases with a sleep problem met criteria for a Delayed Sleep Phase profile. The Delayed Sleep Phase group was younger and had a higher mean Body Mass Index (Body Mass Index) than the other groups. Also, Delayed Sleep Phase cases were significantly more likely to be prescribed mood stabilizers and antidepressant than insomnia cases. An exploratory analysis of selected symptom item ratings indicated that Delayed Sleep Phase was significantly more likely to be associated with impaired energy and activity levels. The cross-sectional design precludes examination of longitudinal changes. Delayed Sleep Phase is identified by sleep profile, not by diagnostic criteria or objective sleep records such as actigraphy.

Managing pain in residents of residential aged care facilities (residential aged care facilities) is challenging, especially for people with dementia. Clinicians must weigh the benefits of analgesic use against the potential for adverse events, particularly daytime sleepiness. Analgesics were used by 288 residents (75.2%) in the previous 24 h. These included paracetamol (n = 264, 68.9%), opioids (n = 110, 28.7%) and oral NSAIDs (n = 14, 3.7%). Overall, 116 (30.3%) residents were categorized as having daytime sleepiness. Of those with dementia, 77 (45.6%) were categorized as having daytime sleepiness. Opioid use in the previous 24 h was not associated with daytime sleepiness in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. Paracetamol use was positively associated with daytime sleepiness (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.20-4.42). Although daytime sleepiness occurred in a large number of residents, especially those with dementia, this sleepiness was not necessarily associated with use of opioids. The risk of opioid-induced sedation may have been managed by strategies including preferential prescribing of paracetamol to residents at risk of sleepiness, opioid discontinuation in residents who experienced sleepiness, and use of low doses of opioids.\n",

The Observation and Interview Based Diurnal Sleepiness Inventory has acceptable validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability properties. The Observation and Interview Based Diurnal Sleepiness Inventory has internal consistency and a reliability coefficient (Pearson rho) of 0.70 for its three items, which suggests strong reliability. The estimated sensitivity and specificity were 0.842 with 95% confidence interval [0.624; 0.945] and 0.851 [0.761; 0.911], respectively. The consistency of summated scale scores during test and retest sessions was high (r = 0.970, 95% bootstrap confidence interval [0.898; 0.991]). Receiver operating characteristic analysis suggests that a cut-point of 6 is effective for identifying older adults with excessive levels of daytime sleepiness. The Observation and Interview Based Diurnal Sleepiness Inventory is a brief, valid, easy-to-administer three-item assessment that can screen for excessive daytime sleepiness among elderly patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The diagnostic value of power spectra analysis of the sleep electroencephalography in narcoleptic patients.  Thirteen features were selected based on the training dataset. Three were applicable in the validation dataset, indicating that narcolepsy with cataplexy patients show (1) increased alpha power in REM sleep, (2) decreased sigma power in wakefulness, and (3) decreased delta power in stage N1 versus wakefulness. Sensitivity of these features ranged from 4% to 10% with specificity around 98%, and it did not vary substantially with and without treatment. EEG spectral analysis of REM sleep, wake, and differences between N1 and wakefulness contain diagnostic features of narcolepsy with cataplexy. These traits may represent sleepiness and dissociated REM sleep in patients with narcolepsy with cataplexy. However, the features are not sufficient for differentiating narcolepsy with cataplexy from controls, and further analysis is needed to completely evaluate the diagnostic potential of these features.\n",

An increased proportion of both tobacco and heavy tobacco smokers was found in NT1 compared to controls and other hypersomniacs, despite adjustments for potential confounders. We reported an increased regular and frequent alcohol drinking habit in NT1 versus controls but not compared to other hypersomniacs in adjusted models. In contrast, heavy drinkers were significantly reduced in NT1 versus controls but not compared to other hypersomniacs. The proportion of patients with excessive drug use (codeine, cocaine, and cannabis), substance dependence, or abuse was low in all subgroups, without significant differences between either hypersomnia disorder categories or compared with controls. We first described a low frequency of illicit drug use, dependence, or abuse in patients with central hypersomnia, whether Hcrt-deficient or not, and whether drug-free or medicated, in the same range as in controls. Conversely, heavy drinkers were rare in NT1 compared to controls but not to other hypersomniacs, without any change in alcohol dependence or abuse frequency. Although disruption of hypocretin signaling in rodents reduces drug-seeking behaviors, our results do not support that hypocretin deficiency constitutes a protective factor against the development of drug addiction in humans.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Emerging drugs for common conditions of sleepiness: obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy. Obstructive sleep apnea (Obstructive sleep apnea) and narcolepsy are sleep disorders associated with high prevalence and high symptomatic burden including prominent sleepiness, daytime dysfunction and poor nocturnal sleep. Both have elevated risk of poor health outcomes. Current therapies are often underutilized, cumbersome, costly or associated with residual symptoms.  Both Obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy are conditions of sleepiness for which lifelong treatments are likely to be required. In Obstructive sleep apnea, while continuous positive airway pressure will likely remain the gold standard therapy for the foreseeable future, there is plenty of room for integrating phenotypes and variants of Obstructive sleep apnea into therapeutic strategies to lead to better, more personalized disease modification. In narcolepsy, unlike Obstructive sleep apnea, drug therapy is the current mainstay of treatment. Advances using novel mechanisms to treat targeted symptoms such as sleepiness and/or novel agents that can treat more than one symptom of narcolepsy, hold promise. However, cost, convenience and side effects remain challenges.\n",

The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement score improved after treatment; responder rate reached 88.9% with 8 mg/24 hours. No patients showed worsening in other secondary outcomes. In 13 patients treated with equivalent doses of rotigotine switched from other dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, and cabergoline), Epworth Sleepiness Scale did not increase after treatment (10.0 +/- 4.6 before and 8.6 +/- 4.5 after treatment) and decreased without worsening of Clinical Global Impression of Improvement in 54% patients. Other secondary outcomes did not worsen after treatment. Twenty four-hour transdermal delivery of rotigotine at doses up to 8 mg/24 hours does not worsen the daytime sleepiness in Parkinson disease patients and often improves it when switched from other non-ergot dopamine agonists.

Compared with an inactive control, continuous positive airway pressure was associated with a reduction in ESS score of 2.5 points (95% CI 2.0-2.9) and mandibular advancement devices of 1.7 points (1.1-2.3). We estimated that, on average, continuous positive airway pressure reduced the ESS score by a further 0.8 points compared with mandibular advancement devices (95% CI 0.1-1.4; p=0.015). However, there was a possibility of publication bias in favour of continuous positive airway pressure that might have resulted in this difference. We noted no evidence that studies reporting higher continuous positive airway pressure adherence also reported larger treatment effects (p=0.70). Continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement devices are effective treatments for reducing daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. Continuous positive airway pressure seemed to be a more effective treatment than mandibular advancement devices, and had an increasingly larger effect in more severe or sleepier obstructive sleep apnoea patients when compared with inactive controls.

Based on LOCF analysis, a statistically significant improvement in the change in BPI average pain scores at week 14 was observed for patients treated with duloxetine compared with placebo. Duloxetine treatment was associated with improved outcomes in nearly all secondary and post hoc analyses. The treatment was generally well tolerated. Somnolence, nausea, and constipation were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the duloxetine group. The discontinuation rates due to treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in both groups.

Hypersomnia of central origin from narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia (idiopathic hypersomnia) is characterized by pathological levels of excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness). Central hypersomnia has historically been underdiagnosed and poorly understood, especially with respect to its impact on daytime functioning and quality of life in children. Compared to healthy controls, children with central hypersomnia had poorer daytime functioning in multiple domains. Children with hypersomnia missed more days of school and had lower grades than healthy controls. Children with hypersomnia had poorer quality of life by both parent and child report. Children with hypersomnia were significantly sleepier, had higher BMI, and were more likely to report a history of recent injury. Finally, children with hypersomnia engaged in fewer after-school activities than healthy controls.

The median (interquartile range) continuous positive airway pressure daily usage was 4.3(0, 6.1)h/day. From the path analysis, continuous positive airway pressure therapy was shown to improve intimate relationship directly (beta=0.185) and indirectly (beta=0.050) by reducing daytime sleepiness and increasing activity level. However, negative emotion symptoms were not the mediators between continuous positive airway pressure adherence and the intimate relationship. continuous positive airway pressure therapy with good adherence is related directly and indirectly to a better intimate relationship with bed partner in men with obstructive sleep apnea. It was possibly attributed to reduced daytime sleepiness and increased activity level.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The effects of acoustical refurbishment of classrooms on teachers' perceived noise exposure and noise-related health symptoms.  Refurbished classrooms were associated with lower perceived noise exposure and lower ratings of disturbance attributed to noise from equipment in the class compared with unrefurbished classrooms. No associations between the classroom refurbishment and health symptoms were observed. Before acoustical refurbishment, the mean classroom reverberation time was 0.68 (school A) and 0.57 (school B) and 0.55 s in sham refurbished classrooms. After refurbishment, the RT was approximately 0.4 s in both schools. Activity sound level measurements confirmed that the intervention had reduced the equivalent sound levels during lessons with circa 2 dB(A) in both schools. The acoustical refurbishment was associated with a reduction in classroom reverberation time and activity sound levels in both schools. The acoustical refurbishment was associated with a reduction in the teachers' perceived noise exposure, and reports of disturbance from equipment in the classroom decreased. There was no significant effect of the refurbishment on the teachers' voice symptoms or fatigue after work.\n",

Initial depression amongst prospective converters was characterized by significantly increased suicidality (odds ratio, OR = 2.31), higher rates of feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt (OR = 2.52), complete loss of pleasure (OR = 2.53) and diurnal variation (OR = 4.30). No differences were found for hyperphagia, hypersomnia and psychomotor alterations. Findings suggest that the symptom profile of initial depressive episodes may be useful in the identification of subjects with an elevated risk for the subsequent conversion to bipolar disorder.\n",

In participants with baseline excessive daytime sleepiness (ESS > 10, n = 109), ESS scores improved significantly by -2.2 (95% CI: -3.0 to -1.4) at 4 months, sustained at 12 months; and almost half no longer had excessive daytime sleepiness by end of program. This study suggests that for employees with excessive daytime sleepiness, short- and long-term improvement in daytime sleepiness may be an unforeseen benefit of workplace physical activity programs.\n",

      "Processing abstract: What Does One Sleep-Onset REM Period--During Either Nocturnal Polysomnography or Multiple Sleep Latency Test--Mean in Differential Diagnosis of Central Hypersomnias?  The authors classified patients as follows: 52 patients had at least 2 SOREMPs (narcolepsy group), 23 had no SOREMPs (idiopathic hypersomnia group), and 26 patients had only 1 SOREMP (intermediate group). In polysomnographic recordings, both mean sleep latency and REM latency were significantly shorter in the narcolepsy (P = 0.012, P < 0.001, respectively) and intermediate groups (P = 0.005 and P = 0.035, respectively) compared with the idiopathic hypersomnia group. In multiple sleep latency test recordings, sleep latency was 2.7 +/- 2.2 minutes in the narcolepsy group, 3.6 +/- 1.4 minutes in the intermediate group, and 5.2 +/- 2.7 minutes in the idiopathic hypersomnia group (P < 0.001). The mean REM latency and sleep stages SOREMPs arised from were similar between the narcolepsy and intermediate groups. To date, SOREMPs in multiple sleep latency test and polysomnography remain the sole electrodiagnostic feature that discriminates narcolepsy without cataplexy from idiopathic hypersomnia. Different parameters or combined criteria are being increasingly investigated to increase the sensitivity and specificity of multiple sleep latency test. The findings showed an altered instability of REM sleep not only in patients with 2 or more SOREMPs in multiple sleep latency test but also in patients with one SOREMP.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Incidence of narcolepsy before and after MF59-adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccination in South Korean soldiers. Previous reports mostly from Europe suggested an association between an occurrence of narcolepsy and an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (Pandemrix((R))). During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic vaccination campaign, the Korean military performed a vaccination campaign with one type of influenza vaccine containing MF59-adjuvants. This study was conducted to investigate the background incidence rate of narcolepsy in South Korean soldiers and the association of the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine with the occurrence of narcolepsy in a young adult group. We included 218 narcolepsy suspicious cases in the initial review, which were screened by the diagnostic code on the computerized disease registry in 2007-2013. Forty-one cases were finally diagnosed with narcolepsy in 2007-2013 (male sex, 95%; median age, 21 years). The average background incidence rate of narcolepsy in Korean soldiers was 0.91 cases per 100,000 persons per year. During the 9 months before vaccination implementation (April to December 2009), 6 narcolepsy cases occurred, whereas during the next 9 months (January to September 2010) including the 3-month vaccination campaign, 5 cases occurred. The incidence of narcolepsy in South Korean soldiers was not increased after the pandemic vaccination campaign using the MF59-adjuvanted vaccine. Our results suggest that the MF59-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine did not contribute to the occurrence of narcolepsy in this young adult group.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Predictors for Development of Excessive Daytime Sleepiness in Women: A Population-Based 10-Year Follow-Up.  At baseline and follow-up, women answered a questionnaire on sleeping habits, somatic disease, obesity, insomnia, anxiety and depression, lifestyle, and social factors. The risk of incident excessive daytime sleepiness was analyzed from changes over time in risk factors using logistic regression modeling. Of the women, excessive daytime sleepiness developed in 7.9%. Incident: insomnia (adjusted odds ratio = 5.01; 95% confidence interval 3.63-6.92), anxiety and/or depression (3.34; 2.22-5.02), somatic disease (1.73; 1.17-2.55), obesity (1.91; 1.14-2.57), snoring (1.91; 1.17-3.10) and smoking (4.31; 1.95-9.54) were all independent risk factors for the development of excessive daytime sleepiness. In addition, persistent: insomnia (4.44; 2.97-6.65) and anxiety and/or depression (4.91; 3.17-7.62) increased the risk of developing excessive daytime sleepiness. Apart from incident: snoring and obesity, similar results were obtained when only including women without somatic disease in the analyses. Insomnia, anxiety and/or depression, and smoking were the most important factors for predicting incident excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) and, in addition, somatic disease, obesity, and snoring predicted excessive daytime sleepiness. It is important not only to treat these conditions but also to inform women of the importance of a healthy lifestyle in order to prevent and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness in women.\n",

Of the adults surveyed, 37% had >= 1 neuropsychiatric symptom and spent $14.8 billion out-of-pocket on complementary and alternative medicine therapies. Those with >= 1 neuropsychiatric symptom were more likely than those without neuropsychiatric symptoms to spend on complementary and alternative medicine therapies (27.4% vs 20.3%, P < .001). Likelihood to spend on complementary and alternative medicine therapies increased with number of symptoms (27.2% with >= 3 symptoms, P < .001). After adjustment was made for confounders using logistic regression, those with >= 1 neuropsychiatric symptom remained more likely to spend on complementary and alternative medicine therapies (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.48), and the likelihood increased to 1.55 (95% CI, 1.34-1.79) for >= 3 symptoms.

The Persian version of Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index had a very good internal consistency and also demonstrated good test-retest reliability. Concurrent validity was confirmed by significant correlations with Epworth Sleepiness Scale, FOSQ-10 and Short form 12 subscale scores. Comparison of Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index scores in groups of patients categorized by Epworth Sleepiness Scale showed the high discriminative power of this instrument. However, there was no significant difference in the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index scores of patients with mild, moderate, and severe sleep apnea. The results of sensitivity to change verified that the Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index was able to detect changes after continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) treatment. The findings of this study indicate that the Persian version of Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index is a reliable, valid, and responsive measure for evaluation of quality of life in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\n",

Women with obstructive sleep apnea had a significantly higher prevalence of periodic limb movements during sleep than men (24.2 vs. 15.9%, p<0.05). Women with obstructive sleep apnea showed an increased prevalence of periodic limb movements during sleep compared to men in the younger group aged <=55years (23.0 vs. 10.6%, p<0.05), but not in the older groups >55years (25.3 vs. 21.6%, p>0.05).

Four patients with comorbidity for narcolepsy type 1 and idiopathic generalized epilepsy are reported: in three cases the onset of epilepsy preceded narcolepsy type 1 appearance, whereas in one case epileptic spells onset was subsequent. Patients presented with absences, myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizure type: in the patient with tonic-clonic seizures the dual pathology was easily recognized, in the other cases the first diagnosis caused the comorbid disease to be overlooked, independent of the time-course sequence. All four patients underwent neurological examination, video-electroencephalogram during which ictal and interictal epileptic discharges were recorded, and sleep polysomnographic studies. Repeated sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs) were documented with the multiple sleep latency test (MLST) in all the four cases. All patients had unremarkable brain magnetic resonance imaging studies and cerebrospinal hypocretin-1 was assessed in two patients, revealing undetectable levels. The association of antiepileptic drugs and substances currently used to treat narcolepsy type 1, including sodium oxybate, was effective in improving seizures, sleep disturbance, and cataplexy. Narcolepsy type 1 may occur in association with idiopathic generalized epilepsy, leading to remarkable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Electrophysiological studies as well as a comprehensive somnologic interview can help confirm the diagnosis in patients with ambiguous neurological history. Sodium oxybate in combination with antiepileptic drugs is safe and effective in treating cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",

Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) has been associated with an increased risk for falls among clinical samples of older adults. However, there is little detailed information among population-representative samples. The current study aimed to assess the relationship between Excessive daytime sleepiness and falls among a cohort of population-based older adults. Among women, 50 (13.6%) individuals reported Excessive daytime sleepiness. Women with Excessive daytime sleepiness were more likely to report a fall, and were more likely to report the fall occurring outside. Excessive daytime sleepiness was similarly associated with an increased risk of a fall following adjustment for use of a walking aid, cases of nocturia and antidepressant medication use (adjusted OR=2.54, 95% CI 1.24-5.21). Multivariate modelling revealed antidepressant use (current) as an effect modifier (p<.001 for the interaction term). After stratifying the data by antidepressant medication use, the association between Excessive daytime sleepiness and falls was sustained following adjustment for nocturia among antidepressant non-users (adjusted OR=2.63, 95% CI 1.31-5.30). Among men, 72 (16.0%) individuals reported Excessive daytime sleepiness. No differences were detected for men with and without Excessive daytime sleepiness in regard to reported falls, and a trend towards significance was noted between Excessive daytime sleepiness and a high falls risk as assessed by the EFST (p=0.06), however, age explained this relationship (age adjusted OR=2.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.10). For women, Excessive daytime sleepiness is independently associated with at least one fall during the previous year, and this is more likely to occur whilst located outside. Amelioration of Excessive daytime sleepiness may assist in improving functional outcomes among these individuals by reducing the risk for falls.\n",

Overall, the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 5.7+/-5.6, 14.9% showing excessive daytime sleepiness with an increasing trend according to Obstructive sleep apnea severity (p<0.001). Sleepy subjects were more frequently men, having a greater body mass index (body mass index), alcohol intake, depression score, and indices of Obstructive sleep apnea severity (23% of severe Obstructive sleep apnea cases being sleepy). No differences were present between sleepy and non-sleepy subjects in regard to other clinical, metabolic, and autonomic nervous system measurements. Regression analyses adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, depression score, autonomic sleep fragmentation, and apnea-hypopnea index and/or oxygen desaturation index revealed that gender (p<0.0001), depression score (p<0.0001), and body mass index (p=0.01) were the only significant factors affecting the presence of sleepiness in this population. In healthy elderly with Obstructive sleep apnea, the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was low, and it affected only severe cases. Despite a weak association between the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score and the apnea-hypopnea index index, male gender and depression score were the most significant predictors for the occurrence of sleepiness.\n",

Prior follow-up studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) ascertained attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder cases in clinical samples mostly from North America but rarely from European countries. They have provided a good deal of information about the persistence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and its impairments, but the degree to which these results generalize to population samples and to other countries is not certain. Prior studies have also not assessed predictors of new-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in youth without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. 86.5% of the families assessed at baseline were followed-up (N = 875). Participants who were and were not interviewed at follow-up did not differ on any clinical or demographic features. At follow-up, the prevalence of full or subthreshold attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was 65.8% for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder participants and 9.8% for those not having attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder at baseline. Among the children who were not diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder at baseline, 3.4% were diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder at follow-up. Both the persistence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and new onsets of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were significantly predicted by several baseline clinical features and by having a family history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (all P values < .05). We replicated prior predictors of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder's persistence and provide new data about predictors of new attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder onsets in the population.

Modafinil is a well-tolerated psychostimulant drug with low addictive potential that is used to treat patients with narcolepsy and other excessive sleepiness. Whereas favorable effects of modafinil on cognitive functions have been shown in a large number of studies, there are very few reports presenting the effects of modafinil electrophysiologically. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of modafinil on auditory P300 latency and amplitude electrophysiologically. After 1 week of modafinil treatment, mean P300 latencies (at all electrode sites) were significantly lower than the latencies before the treatment (P values for Fz, Cz and Pz recording sites were 0.039, 0.002, and 0.004, respectively). An increase in the P300 amplitudes was detected only at the Fz recording site, but not at Cz or Pz recording sites (P values for Fz, Cz, and Pz recording sites were 0.014, 0.100, and 0.05, respectively). One week of modafinil treatment improved the cognitive performance, alertness, and executive functions in IH patients.

      "Processing abstract: Correlates of excessive daytime sleepiness in de novo Parkinson's disease: A case control study.  Four hundred twenty-three Parkinson's disease subjects and 196 healthy controls were recruited into the study. Mean Epworth Sleepiness scale (min, max) score was 5.8 (0, 20) for the Parkinson's disease subjects and 5.6 (0, 19) for healthy controls (P=0.54). Sixty-six (15.6%) Parkinson's disease subjects and 24 (12%) healthy controls had Epworth Sleepiness scale of at least 10 (P=0.28). No difference was seen in demographic characteristics, age of onset, disease duration, Parkinson's disease subtype, cognitive status, or utilization of sedatives between the Parkinson's disease sleepiness-positive versus the negative group. The sleepiness-positive group had higher MDS-UParkinson's diseaseRS Part I and II but not III scores, and higher depression and autonomic dysfunction scores. Sleepiness was associated with a marginal reduction of A-beta (P=0.05) but not alpha-synuclein spinal fluid levels in Parkinson's disease. This largest case control study demonstrates no difference in prevalence of excessive sleepiness in subjects with de novo untreated Parkinson's disease compared with healthy controls. The only clinical correlates of sleepiness were mood and autonomic dysfunction. Ongoing longitudinal analyses will be essential to further examine clinical and biological correlates of sleepiness in Parkinson's disease and specifically the role of dopaminergic therapy.\n",

A combination of two items, \"in the morning, when relaxing\" and \"in the afternoon, standing inactive, in a public place,\" presented the highest correlations with the maintenance of wakefulness test (r: -0.50, p < 0.001), the multiple sleep latency test (r: -0.21, p = 0.07), and the sustained attention to response task (r: 0.27, p < 0.02) and constituted the Barcelona Sleepiness Index. The Barcelona Sleepiness Index significantly correlated with oxyhemoglobin saturation measures (nadir SpO2: r: -0.28, p = 0.01; CT 85: r: 0.23, p = 0.04) and showed a high sensitivity to change with continuous positive airway pressure treatment (t: 3.4, p = 0.002). A score of 2 or more identified patients with objective excessive daytime sleepiness (sensitivity = 64.9%, specificity = 72.1%). The Barcelona Sleepiness Index is a simple, brief instrument for measuring subjective excessive daytime sleepiness in sleep-disordered breathing.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Clarithromycin in gamma-aminobutyric acid-Related hypersomnolence: A randomized, crossover trial.  Twenty-three patients began treatment. Three patients dropped out, and final analyses were performed on 20 complete cases. Median reaction time was not significantly different between clarithromycin and placebo. Subjective measures of sleepiness were significantly improved on clarithromycin versus placebo. Altered taste perception occurred, but was the only side effect more common on clarithromycin than placebo. No serious adverse events occurred. Subjective sleepiness, but not psychomotor vigilance, improved during a 2-week course of clarithromycin. Although additional studies are needed, this suggests that clarithromycin may be a reasonable treatment option in patients with treatment-refractory hypersomnolence.

In the mixed model for repeated measures analysis of the primary end-point (with Hochberg correction for multiplicity), least squares (least squares) mean differences between asenapine and placebo on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) total score at day 56 were not significant (-4.8 for 2.5mg b.i.d., p=0.070; -5.6 for 5mg b.i.d., p=0.064). Significant improvement in the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity score was observed in the 5mg b.i.d. group versus placebo on day 56 (least squares mean -0.3, p=0.024). In the acute phase, >=7% weight gain and the composite event of somnolence, sedation, and hypersomnia were more common in both asenapine groups than in the placebo group. Akathisia, fasting glucose elevation, and extrapyramidal syndrome were more common in the 5mg b.i.d. group than in the placebo group. There were no unexpected adverse events in the open-label extension, and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores decreased by -16.1 points in the group previously treated with placebo (n=62) and by -11.2 points in the continuous asenapine group (n=131) from open-label extension baseline to week 26. Although improvements in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score at day 56 of the acute phase were numerically greater for both asenapine 2.5 and 5mg b.i.d. than for placebo and were maintained in the open-label extension, the primary end-point did not achieve statistical significance in the acute phase. No new or unexpected safety concerns were detected during the acute phase or after an additional 26 weeks of asenapine treatment in the adolescent population with schizophrenia.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Development of excessive daytime sleepiness in early Parkinson disease.  Patients reported excessive daytime sleepiness more often than control participants at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up. The frequency of excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson disease increased from 11.8% at baseline to 23.4% after 5 years. Associated factors were male sex, the use of dopamine agonists, and higher Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-activities of daily living scores. Main risk factor for developing excessive daytime sleepiness was an increased Epworth Sleepiness Scale score at baseline. excessive daytime sleepiness is more frequent in Parkinson disease even before treatment initiation compared with control participants and increases in occurrence with disease progression. The main risk factor for developing excessive daytime sleepiness with time is an early predisposition for sleepiness. In addition, the use of dopamine agonists was associated with the development of excessive daytime sleepiness. These findings necessitate caution in patients with Parkinson disease and early increased sleep propensity and when using dopamine agonists.\n",

Bilateral paramedian thalamic stroke is characterized by hypersomnia, vertical gaze palsy, amnestic alteration, and apathic state. Combined lesion of the paramedian thalamus and mesencephalon bilaterally is extremely rare. Little is known about the breathing disturbances of the particular region due to the lesion. The following describes the specific case of a woman, age 62, with bilateral paramedian thalamic and mesencephalic stroke. Initially, the patient's complaints exhibited altered vigilance and vertical gaze palsy. Notably, following the acute phase, fluctuating hypersomnia was detected. The MRI (brain) revealed an ischemic lesion in the medial part of the mesencephalon and paramedian thalamus, bilaterally. Sleep structure examination featured a decrease in N3 and REM ratio and an increase in N1 and N2 ratio with minimal improvement during the recovery period. In contrast, significant changes were found in the breathing pattern: the initial central apnea dominance was followed by obstructive apneas with a gradual decrease of the total pathological respiratory events. In addition to the structural abnormality of the sleep regulating network, sleep-disordered breathing is another possible cause of hypersomnia in patients afflicted with the present localization of the lesion.\n",

Median Epworth sleepiness scale (Epworth sleepiness scale) was 13 (IQR, 6-16) and median apnoea-hypopnoea index (apnoea-hypopnoea index) was 35.9 (IQR, 27.6-56.3). There were no significant differences in baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between groups. Overall, no significant differences were found at the first month assessment. After 3 months of therapy, we found again no differences in residual apnoea-hypopnoea index or Epworth sleepiness scale.

Epidemiological studies suggest the importance of environmental factors in the etiology of narcolepsy-cataplexy in genetically predisposed subjects. Fifty four patients (55.6% males) answered the questionnaire, The mean age at onset of the first symptom was 21.6 +/- 9.3 years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 36.5 +/- 12.4 years. The main finding in narcoleptic patients as compared to control subjects was major changes in the 'number of arguments with partner, family, or friends' (odds ratio: 5.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.8-14.5). This can be interpreted as having a protective function and it suggests that psychological mechanisms are present since the beginning of the disease. As for the infectious factors, chickenpox was the most frequently reported. No significant differences were found in terms of total numbers of stress-related and infectious factors between cases and controls. Prospective studies regarding the interaction between environmental and genetic factors are warranted.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prader-Willi syndrome: a review of clinical, genetic, and endocrine findings. Prader-Willi syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome) is a multisystemic complex genetic disorder caused by lack of expression of genes on the paternally inherited chromosome 15q11.2-q13 region. There are three main genetic subtypes in Prader-Willi syndrome: paternal 15q11-q13 deletion (65-75 % of cases), maternal uniparental disomy 15 (20-30 % of cases), and imprinting defect (1-3 %). DNA methylation analysis is the only technique that will diagnose Prader-Willi syndrome in all three molecular genetic classes and differentiate Prader-Willi syndrome from Angelman syndrome. Clinical manifestations change with age with hypotonia and a poor suck resulting in failure to thrive during infancy. As the individual ages, other features such as short stature, food seeking with excessive weight gain, developmental delay, cognitive disability and behavioral problems become evident. The phenotype is likely due to hypothalamic dysfunction, which is responsible for hyperphagia, temperature instability, high pain threshold, hypersomnia and multiple endocrine abnormalities including growth hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone deficiencies, hypogonadism and central adrenal insufficiency. Obesity and its complications are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Prader-Willi syndrome.  Updated information regarding the early diagnosis and management of individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome is important for all physicians and will be helpful in anticipating and managing or modifying complications associated with this rare obesity-related disorder.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Car Crashes and Central Disorders of Hypersomnolence: A French Study. Drowsiness compromises driving ability by reducing alertness and attentiveness, and delayed reaction times. Sleep-related car crashes account for a considerable proportion of accident at the wheel. Narcolepsy type 1 (Narcolepsy type 1), narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy type 2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (idiopathic hypersomnia) are rare central disorders of hypersomnolence, the most severe causes of sleepiness thus being potential dangerous conditions for both personal and public safety with increasing scientific, social, and political attention. Our main objective was to assess the frequency of recent car crashes in a large cohort of patients affected with well-defined central disorders of hypersomnolence versus subjects from the general population. Patients reported more frequently than healthy subjects the occurrence of recent car crashes (in the previous five years), a risk that was confirmed in both treated and untreated subjects at study inclusion (Untreated, OR = 2.21 95%CI = [1.30-3.76], Treated OR = 2.04 95%CI = [1.26-3.30]), as well as in all disease categories, and was modulated by subjective sleepiness level (Epworth scale and naps). Conversely, the risk of car accidents of patients treated for at least 5 years was not different to healthy subjects (OR = 1.23 95%CI = [0.56-2.69]). Main risk factors were analogous in patients and healthy subjects. Patients affected with central disorders of hypersomnolence had increased risk of recent car crashes compared to subjects from the general population, a finding potentially reversed by long-term treatment.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prevalence and Clinical Correlates of a Short Onset rapid eye movement Period (SOrapid eye movementP) during Routine polysomnography.  For patients being evaluated for hypersomnolence, the prevalence of polysomnography SOrapid eye movementP increased in a dose-response fashion with the number of rapid eye movement onsets that occurred on a consecutive MSLT (0.5% for no MSLT SOrapid eye movementPs to > 33.0% for those with 5 MSLT SOrapid eye movementPs). Overall, having a polysomnography SOrapid eye movementP was highly specific (99.5%; 95% CI: 99.1-99.7%) but not sensitive (6.7%; 95% CI: 4.7-9.2%) for narcolepsy. The prevalence of polysomnography SOrapid eye movementP for patients in the general sleep clinic sample (i.e., not being evaluated by a consecutive MSLT) was 0.8% and was much higher in those that work night/swing shift. In adjusted models, African American race contributed to the most variance in polysomnography SOrapid eye movementP. A short onset rapid eye movement (rapid eye movement) latency occurs rarely in general sleep clinic samples (< 1.0%), but is highly specific for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. Although rare, the prevalence of the phenomenon is much higher than the estimated prevalence of narcolepsy and may provide a critical opportunity for practitioners to identify narcolepsy in sleep clinic patients. These data also suggest that the utility of polysomnography (polysomnography) short onset rapid eye movement peroid (SOrapid eye movementP) for the diagnosis of narcolepsy may be altered by a history of shift/night work and/ or other factors that may allow for a rebound of rapid eye movement sleep (e.g., undergoing a positive airway pressure titration), supporting published guidelines that other sleep disorders and insufficient and/or poorly timed sleep should be ruled out and/or adequately controlled for prior to conducting sleep testing. Further research is needed to understand racial differences in polysomnography SOrapid eye movementP and narcolepsy. This study was limited in that data on cataplexy (with exception to that in final diagnosis) and habitual sleep duration were not available.\n",

However, the relationship between restless leg syndrome and multiple sclerosis is still unclear. This case-control study aimed to measure restless leg syndrome prevalence and uncover its association with multiple sclerosis, as well as to identify possible associated risk factors. We found there to be a significantly higher prevalence of restless leg syndrome among patients with multiple sclerosis compared to healthy controls (odds ratio [OR], 3.8; P<0.001). Risk factors such as an older multiple sclerosis age at onset and a longer multiple sclerosis duration were significantly associated with the presence of restless leg syndrome. Furthermore, patients with both multiple sclerosis and restless leg syndrome were more likely to suffer from sleep complaints compared to patients with multiple sclerosis without restless leg syndrome. restless leg syndrome was significantly associated with multiple sclerosis and was found to have a significant impact on sleep quality, particularly in patients with multiple sclerosis.\n",

Increased axial diffusivity values were also shown in the Parkinson's disease-excessive daytime sleepiness group, in the left anterior thalamic radiation and the corticospinal tract and bilaterally in the superior corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus. Levodopa equivalent dose differed significantly between the groups and was the only predictor of excessive daytime sleepiness, while the only predictor of the Epworth sleepiness scale score in the Parkinson's disease-excessive daytime sleepiness group was the dopamine-agonist dose. Increased frequency of gamblers was also observed in the Parkinson's disease-excessive daytime sleepiness group. Regional Gray matter increases and increased axial diffusivity values in certain white matter tracts were found in the Parkinson's disease-excessive daytime sleepiness group. The changes could result from disinhibited signaling pathways or represent compensatory changes in response to anatomical or functional deficits elsewhere. The study findings support also the contribution of the total dopaminergic load in the development of excessive daytime sleepiness, while the dose of dopamine agonists was found to predict the severity of the disorder.\n",

Risk of bias was unclear in one or more key domains for four studies. When compared with placebo, wakefulness promoting agents decreased Epworth Sleepiness Scale by 2.51 points (95% CI, 2.00-3.02), increased sleep latency in maintenance of wakefulness test by 2.73 minutes (95% CI, 2.12-3.34), increased the reporting of minimal improvement on the Clinical Global Impression of Change by 26% (RR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.36-1.86), and increased the risk of headaches by 8% (RR 1.98; 95% CI, 1.48-2.63).

The highest prevalence of altered transition from stage non-N2/N3 to stage R in multiple sleep latency test (multiple sleep latency test) and nocturnal polysomnography (nocturnal polysomnography) was found in patients with type 1 narcolepsy (92.0% and 57.1%), followed by patients with type 2 narcolepsy (69.4% and 12.8%), unaffected relatives (46.2% and 0%), and controls (39.3% and 1.3%). Individual sleep variables had varied sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing narcolepsy. By incorporating a combination of sleep variables, the decision tree analysis improved the sensitivity to 94.3% and 82.1% and enhanced specificity to 82.4% and 83% for the diagnosis of type 1 and type 2 narcolepsy, respectively. There was a significant association of DBQ1*0602 with the altered sleep stage transition (OR = 16.0, 95% CI: 1.7-149.8, p = 0.015). The persistence of the altered sleep stage transition in both multiple sleep latency test and nocturnal polysomnography was high for both type 1 (90.5% and 64.7%) and type 2 narcolepsy (92.3% and 100%), respectively. Altered sleep stage transition is a significant and stable marker of narcolepsy, which suggests a vulnerable wake-sleep dysregulation trait in narcolepsy. Altered sleep stage transition has a significant diagnostic value in the differential diagnosis of hypersomnias, especially when combined with other diagnostic sleep variables in decision tree analysis.\n",

Daily function (FOSQ) in the risk group was significantly improved with heated humidification (90.0+/-11.9 vs. 82.0+/-12.0 (p<0.05)). heated humidification showed a tendency to improve APositive airway pressure adherence. The adherence in both groups was quite high, and for that reason, it is difficult to show a statistically significant effect.

      "Processing abstract: Meta-analysis of self-reported daytime napping and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality. Whether self-reported daytime napping is an independent predictor of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate self-reported daytime napping and risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality by conducting a meta-analysis. Seven studies with 98,163 subjects were included. Self-reported daytime napping was associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.07-1.24) compared with non-nappers. Risk of all-cause mortality appeared to be more pronounced among persons with nap duration >60 min (RR 1.15; 95% CI 1.04-1.27) than persons with nap duration <60 min (RR 1.10; 95% CI 0.92-1.32). The pooled RR of cardiovascular mortality was 1.19 (95% CI 0.97-1.48) comparing daytime nappers to non-nappers. Self-reported daytime napping is a mild but statistically significant predictor for all-cause mortality, but not for cardiovascular mortality. However, whether the risk is attributable to excessive sleep duration or napping alone remains controversial. More prospective studies stratified by sleep duration, napping periods, or age are needed.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Allergies and Disease Severity in Childhood Narcolepsy: Preliminary Findings. Narcolepsy frequently begins in childhood, and is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, with the presence of cataplexy reflecting a more severe phenotype. Narcolepsy may result from genetic predisposition involving deregulation of immune pathways, particularly involving T helper 2 cells (T helper 2 cells). Increased activation of T helper 2 cells cells is usually manifested as allergic conditions such as rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. We hypothesized that the presence of allergic conditions indicative of increased T helper 2 cells balance may dampen the severity of the phenotype in children with narcolepsy. There were 468 children identified, with 193 children in NC- group and 275 patients in the NC+ group. Overall, NC+ children were significantly younger, had higher body mass index, and had shorter mean sleep latencies and increased sleep onset rapid eye movement events. The frequency of allergic conditions, particularly asthma and allergic rhinitis, was markedly lower in NC+ (58/275) compared to NC- patients (94/193; P < 0.0001). Involvement of the immune system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. Current findings further suggest that an increased shift toward T helper 2 cells, as indicated by the presence of allergic conditions, may modulate the severity of the phenotype in childhood narcolepsy, and reduce the prevalence of cataplexy in these patients.\n",

In children and adolescents, the age-standardized adjusted incidence rate significantly increased from 0.14/100,000 person-years in the pre-pandemic period to 0.50/100,000 person-years in the post-pandemic period (incidence density ratio, IDR 3.57; 95% CI 1.94-7.00). In adults, no significant change was detectable. This increase started in spring 2009. For the years 2007-2011, valid estimates for the incidence of narcolepsy in Germany were provided. In individuals under 18, the incidence rates continuously increased from spring 2009.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep complaints in survivors of pediatric brain tumors.  One-third of adolescents and one-fifth of children reported excessive daytime sleepiness. Children and parents had fair concordance (kappa coefficient=.64) in their report of excessive daytime sleepiness, while adolescents and parents had poor concordance (kappa coefficient=.37). Per parents, most children slept 8 to 9 h per night. Poor bedtime routines were reported for children, while adolescents endorsed poor sleep stability. Extended weekend sleep was reported across age groups. A BMI in the obese range was related to higher parent-reported excessive daytime sleepiness in children. Sleep-disordered breathing was associated with elevated BMI in adolescents. While survivors reported achieving recommended amounts of sleep each night, 20 to 30% reported excessive daytime sleepiness. Poor concordance among parent and adolescent report highlights the importance of obtaining self-report when assessing sleep concerns. Obesity is a modifiable factor in reducing symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness in this population. Finally, the lack of association between excessive daytime sleepiness and brain tumor location, BMI, or treatment received was unexpected and warrants further investigation.\n",

During the 8-month study period, 156 patients were included and 133 (85.2%) patients survived to hospital discharge. Of the survivors, atypical antipsychotic therapy was continued for 112 (84.2%) patients upon intensive care unit transfer and for 38 (28.6%) patients upon hospital discharge. A majority of these patients had evidence of delirium resolution or no indication for continuation documented at discharge. Of the 127 patients with an electrocardiogram ordered during atypical antipsychotic therapy, QTc prolongation occurred in 49 (31.4%) patients. An adverse drug event leading to drug discontinuation was documented in 16 (10.2%) patients.

Olanzapine long-acting injection (long-acting injection) for the treatment of schizophrenia was associated with a cluster of symptoms termed post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome) in a small percentage (~2%) of patients during clinical trials. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the rate and clinical characteristics of post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome since olanzapine long-acting injection entered commercial use. A total of 338 post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome events were identified. Of these, 91% occurred within 1 hour of injection, and 52% of these occurred within 15 minutes. None of the post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome events in this analysis were fatal, and most resolved within 72 hours. The most common symptoms (occurring in >30% of cases) were sedation (61%), confusion (56%), dysarthria (54%), somnolence (46%), dizziness (45%) and disorientation (35%). Overall, post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome occurred with approximately 0.07% of injections and in 0.46-1.03% of patients (reporting and incidence rates from spontaneous reports and post-marketing safety studies, respectively). The post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome events reported during routine clinical use of olanzapine long-acting injection are generally similar in incidence and presentation to those reported in clinical trials. Caution should be applied when interpreting spontaneously reported rates of adverse events, however, due to potential under-reporting. Implemented risk-minimisation activities may contribute substantially to the identification and appropriate management of patients with post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome in clinical practice.\n",
      "Processing abstract: An unusual occurrence of Kleine-Levin syndrome in a man with refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura: a case report. Kleine-Levin syndrome is an extremely rare neurological entity characterized by recurrent episodes of hypersomnia which are sometimes associated with compulsive hyperphagia and behavioral changes. Autoimmunity has recently been proposed as a factor contributing to its pathogenesis. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a relatively common autoimmune disease showing a lot of complexity and uncertainty regarding its treatment regimens and its refractory nature in some cases.  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura may be associated with meningococcal vaccination in adulthood. Responses to treatment in immune thrombocytopenic purpura vary among patients. Our patient only had a transient acceptable response to intravenous immunoglobulin while all other options failed to improve his platelet count. Concurrence of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and Kleine-Levin syndrome supports the role of autoimmunity as the proposed pathophysiological mechanism of Kleine-Levin syndrome.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Perampanel efficacy and tolerability with enzyme-inducing AEDs in patients with epilepsy.  Treatment response assessed by median percent reduction in seizure frequency and responder rates improved with perampanel compared with placebo. However, at 8 and 12 mg, the treatment response was significantly greater in patients receiving non-enzyme (CYP3A4)-inducer antiepileptic drugs. The treatment effect (perampanel-placebo) also demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in all patients. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar regardless of the presence of enzyme (CYP3A4)-inducer antiepileptic drugs. Occurrence of some adverse events, such as fatigue, somnolence, dizziness, irritability, was greater in patients receiving non-enzyme (CYP3A4)-inducer antiepileptic drugs, as was discontinuation because of adverse events. Perampanel shows efficacy and safety in the presence and absence of enzyme (CYP3A4)-inducer antiepileptic drugs. As systemic exposure to perampanel increases, so does efficacy. Given the extensive metabolism of perampanel, systemic exposure is clearly reduced with concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers. This supports the strategy of dosing perampanel to clinical effect. Recognition of these pharmacokinetic interactions will be important in the optimization of this novel medication.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Obstructive sleep apnoea and non-restorative sleep induced by the interface. There are only few data about the influence of interfaces on restorative sleep and required CPAP/APAP levels in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (obstructive sleep apnoea). Observations of obstructive apnoeas when using oro-nasal masks with normalisation of respiratory disturbance index (respiratory disturbance index) under nasal masks and of non-restorative sleep under oro-nasal masks in spite of normal respiratory disturbance index led to a registration of patients with such findings. Sixty-five patients (BMI 32.2+/-8.1kg/m(2); 64.4+/-12.8years) with obstructive sleep apnoea (n=54) and non-restorative sleep with normal respiratory disturbance index (n=11) under oro-nasal masks were included. In the group of patients with pathologic respiratory disturbance index under oro-nasal masks (n=54), switching the interface to a nasal mask normalised respiratory disturbance index (31.8+/-16.3 to 6.0+/-3.6/h [p<0.001]) and arousal index (p<0.001); slow-wave and REM sleep increased (p<0.05). In the patient group with a pathological respiratory disturbance index under CPAP/APAP therapy (n=45), the pressure decreased from 9.5+/-2.2 to 7.3+/-2.0cmhPa (p<0.001), and in the group with normal respiratory disturbance index (n=11) from 10.1+/-2.4 to 6.8+/-1.2hPa (p<0.01). The usage of an oro-nasal mask can result in a paradoxical induction of obstructive hypopnoeas or apnoeas. Clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon. When adapting patients to a PAP therapy, a nasal mask should be preferred even if patients report mouth breathing.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Insomnia and somnolence associated with second-generation antidepressants during the treatment of major depression: a meta-analysis. Sleep reduction or enhancement is frequently observed with second-generation antidepressant treatments, and they can be beneficial or harmful depending on the symptom profile of each subject. Nevertheless, relatively little attention has been given so far to rank those effects across compounds. The aim of this meta-analysis is to provide quantitative data about short-term rates of insomnia and somnolence associated with 14 second-generation antidepressants during the treatment of major depression. Ten second-generation antidepressants showed higher rates of insomnia than placebo. The highest incidence was found for bupropion and desvenlafaxine. Agomelatine was the only antidepressant with a lower likelihood of inducing insomnia than placebo. Eleven antidepressants were associated with higher rates of somnolence than placebo. Fluvoxamine and mirtazapine showed the highest frequency of somnolence. Bupropion induced somnolence to a lower extent than placebo. Sensitivity analyses showed a degree of variation of those findings. Antidepressants are associated with different insomnia and somnolence rates, mainly depending on their mechanisms of action. Despite some limitations, we underscore that the treatment-emergent insomnia and/or somnolence are frequent, and they could be used in clinical practice to face the specific needs of each patient.\n",

The prevalence of excessive sleepiness was higher with greater severity of obstructive sleep apnea: 40.5% in the patients without obstructive sleep apnea (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) <5), 46.5% in mild obstructive sleep apnea (AHI 5-14.9), 52.0% in moderate obstructive sleep apnea (AHI 15-29.9), and 58.0% in severe obstructive sleep apnea (AHI 30 or above). In contrast, the prevalence of insomnia using the 2014 diagnostic criteria showed an opposing prevalence: 54.2% no obstructive sleep apnea, 54.9% mild obstructive sleep apnea, 48.5% moderate obstructive sleep apnea, and 44.6% severe obstructive sleep apnea. Logistic and linear regression analyses showed that sleepiness was positively associated whereas insomnia was negatively associated with obstructive sleep apnea severity and AHI. Both excessive sleepiness and insomnia were seen in high proportions of the patients referred on suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea. Excessive sleepiness was higher whereas insomnia was lower with greater obstructive sleep apnea severity.\n",

Patients were hospitalized between the age of 13days to 1year and 3months for hypersomnia, developmental retardation, feeding deficiency, vomiting, icterus and recurrent pneumonia. All patients had significantly elevated urine 5-oxoproline. Three novel mutations (c.1904G>A and c.2813_2815delGGG in Patient 1, c.2978G>T in Patient 2) on OPLAH, on glutathione synthetase, one novel mutation (c.1252C>T in Patient 3) and a reported mutation (c.491G>A in Patients 3-5) were detected. Patient 4 has homozygous mutation c.491G>A, the others are heterozygous. After treatment by l-carnitine, vitamin E, B1, B2 and coenzyme Q10, three patients with glutathione synthetase deficiency improved, but the two 5-oxoprolinase-deficient patients did not respond to treatment. 5-Oxoprolinase deficiency and glutathione synthetase deficiency share some clinical and biochemical features. Genetic analysis is important for the deferential diagnosis. In this study, five Chinese patients had severe central nervous system damage. Antioxidant treatments were proved effective for the three patients with glutathione synthetase deficiency but not for the two patients with 5-oxoprolinase deficiency.\n",
      "Processing abstract: A new approach in the diagnosis of upper airway resistance syndrome (Upper airway resistance syndrome): positive airway pressure method. Upper airway resistance syndrome (Upper airway resistance syndrome) is characterized by repeated number of arousals at night, and excessive daytime sleepiness or somnolence (excessive daytime sleepiness or somnolence). It is often missed in classical polysomnographic diagnostic approaches and misdiagnosed as simple snoring or idiopathic hypersomnia, thereby is often left untreated. We propose that positive airway pressure (positive airway pressure), which has shown to be effective against Upper airway resistance syndrome, can be used as a diagnostic tool as well. The study designed to test whether patients with high titration pressures can be diagnosed for Upper airway resistance syndrome, and whether this pressure can be used as the treatment pressure in Upper airway resistance syndrome. Fourteen (%46.7) of the patients were male, 16 (%53.3) were female, with a mean age of 46.4 +/- 9.9 and mean body mass index (BMI) of 26 +/- 3.3. The patiens had a mean Epworth sleepiness scale 15.3 +/- 3.9, mean AHI: 2.3 +/- 1.4 and average RERA: 26.1 +/- 4.9. The mean Cpositive airway pressure titration pressure was 7.1 +/- 1.1 cmH2O. In the light of current findings, during positive airway pressure titration patients required high pressures is the evidence of increased upper airway resistance in Upper airway resistance syndrome. Using the from therapy to diagnosis protocol, the positive airway pressure protocol determines the individual therapeutic pressures needed by patients. Following up the clinical outcomes of these patients under the positive airway pressure treatment, and including a larger cohort will contribute greatly to treating this syndrome, defined as one of the \"unresolved problems in years\".\n",

To conduct an overview of existing systematic reviews concerning management of obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome (obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome) with mandibular advancement splint (mandibular advancement splint) and assess their methodological quality. Eight systematic reviews, four incorporating meta-analyses, were identified evaluating both objective and subjective outcome measures. The effectiveness of mandibular advancement splint therapy was compared to no treatment (n=1), non-active appliance (n=6), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; n=5), surgical intervention (n=3) and a different mandibular advancement splint intervention (n=4). The quality of the reviews was variable (median=7, range=3 to 11), with only two of higher quality (AMSTAR scores >10), one of them a Cochrane review. In this high quality and current review, the overall (pooled) effects for comparison of mandibular advancement splint therapy with inactive appliances, revealed significant benefits of mandibular advancement splint therapy in terms of both daytime sleepiness and objective apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) outcomes. In general, the results from the higher quality reviews concerning the effectiveness of mandibular advancement splint therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome highlight the ability of the intervention to improve obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome. Current reporting guidelines for systematic reviews (e.g. PRISMA) and sources of high-quality existing reviews should be closely followed to enhance the validity and relevance of future reviews.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Relationship between energy expenditure, physical activity and weight loss during CPAP treatment in obese obstructive sleep apnea subjects. Increased energy expenditure (expenditure) has been reported in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea). It has been postulated that CPAP treatment may induce weight reduction in obese patients, even if it has not been confirmed by recent studies. In the present study we investigated the effect of obstructive sleep apnea on expenditure and the effect of CPAP on body weight and physical activity. Baseline total expenditure was similar in the two groups, but obstructive sleep apnea patients showed higher expenditure during the night, while control group during daytime. In patients, expenditure correlates with obstructive sleep apnea severity, degree of daytime sleepiness or obesity. At follow-up evaluation, BMI and total expenditure were unchanged. However, daytime expenditure increased (1066+/-131.5 vs 1104+/-133Kcal/die, p<0.001, respectively) and night expenditure decreased (694+/-69 vs 595+/-73, p<0.0001, respectively). Statistically significant changes in BMI, sleepiness scale, blood gases and expenditure were found only in patients who were compliant to CPAP. Obese obstructive sleep apnea patients showed an increased night expenditure that was normalized only in those patients compliant to CPAP. Body weight and daily physical activity did not change in statistically significant way.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Effect of sertraline on breathing in depressed patients without moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders. Previous studies have reported that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) might improve sleep-related breathing disorders (sleep-related breathing disorders). However, the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on breathing are not evaluated in subjects without moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders. Further, many symptoms of depression and sleep-related breathing disorders overlap, and so, it is interesting whether there are interactions between breathing and psychopathologic symptoms during SSRI treatment for depression. The clinical responses and PSG characteristics improved continuously during the 8-week trial. From the 14th day on, the RERA index during all-night and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep became stable and significantly higher than baseline and the first day (RERA index 7.3+/-2.2 at baseline, 7.3+/-2.5 on the 1st day, 4.4+/-1.9 on the 14th day, 3.9+/-1.3 on the 28th day, 4.2+/-2.0 on the 56th day, F=5.71, P=0.02; NREM-RERA index 6.2+/-2.0 at baseline, 6.3+/-2.3 on the 1st day, 3.2+/-1.5 on the 14th day, 3.5+/-0.9 on the 28th day, 3.2+/-1.7 on the 56th day, F=4.92, P=0.03). Additionally, the NREM-apnea index showed a similar pattern to that of the RERA index and reached a significant difference between baseline (1.0+/-0.5) and the 14th day (0.5+/-0.4) (KW=4.28, P=0.047). Compared to the no-improvement group, the improvement group with a decreasing score rate of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) greater than or equal to -50% had a more positive decreasing score rate of slow wave sleep (SWS) (439.0+/-78.2 vs 373.2+/-77.9%, T=3.46, P=0.04) and a more negative decreasing score rate on the arousal index (-43.7+/-16.7 vs -26.6+/-9.7%, T=9.16, P=0.01), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) scores (-65.1+/-33.7 vs -49.6+/-21.4%, T=4.74, P=0.05), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores (-55.7+/-21.3 vs -36.4+/-17.5%, T=6.44, P=0.02). This research indicates that sleep-related breathing disorders could be improved to some extent by sertraline treatment, which might be more common in patients with relatively more severe sleep-disordered breathing (e.g., RDI>=10 in the current study). Although the sertraline-induced SRBD improvement seems not to have a significant clinical effect, the SRBD improvement group with decreasing score rate of RDI greater than or equal to -50% has better subjective and objective sleep aspects than the no-improvement group. Thus, the fact that the sleep-related breathing disorders' improvement was related to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might have a potential clinical benefit in the antidepressant treatment.\n",

T-cell recognition of M6 and streptodornase B was confirmed at the single-cell level by intracellular cytokine (IL-2, interferon-gamma, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-17) production after stimulation with synthetic M6 or streptodornase B peptides. Significantly, higher (P=0.02) titres of serum antistreptolysin O were observed in narcolepsy cases, compared to vaccinated controls. beta-haemolytic group A streptococcal may be involved in triggering autoimmune responses in patients who developed narcolepsy symptoms after vaccination with Pandemrix in Sweden, characterized by a Streptococcus pyogenes M-type-specific IFN-gamma cellular immune response.\n",

Symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and major depressive disorder at age 4 were statistically linked to insomnia at age 6. Sleepwalking predicted later separation anxiety disorder, whereas hypersomnia was unrelated to symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Insomnia is a prevalent and stable disorder in children and is bidirectionally related to psychiatric symptoms.\n",

      "Adolescents spent a large amount of time during the day and at bedtime using electronic devices. Daytime and bedtime use of electronic devices were both related to sleep measures, with an increased risk of short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and increased sleep deficiency. A dose-response relationship emerged between sleep duration and use of electronic devices, exemplified by the association between PC use and risk of less than 5h of sleep (OR=2.70, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.39), and comparable lower odds for 7-8h of sleep (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.96). Use of electronic devices is frequent in adolescence, during the day as well as at bedtime. The results demonstrate a negative relation between use of technology and sleep, suggesting that recommendations on healthy media use could include restrictions on electronic devices.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep disorders and circadian rhythm in epilepsy revisited: a prospective controlled study.  Forty-one percent of the participants reported on the acute effects of present or past seizures on sleep-wake rhythm, whereas chronic effects were not evident. Participants and controls did not differ in the rates of chronic sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and presence of sleep disorders (all p-values non-significant or n.s.). Apart from earlier sleep times on workdays (p = 0.001) in those with epilepsy, circadian variables were similarly distributed. Epilepsy was well controlled, with 75.9% being seizure free for >= 1 year. Longer durations of epilepsy showed a negative correlation with sleep quality (rho = -0.256, p < 0.001). Participants with generalized and partial epilepsies did not differ in rates of sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep disorders, and variables of circadian rhythm (all p-values n.s.). The present study demonstrated that chronic sleep disturbance is not increased in patients with well-controlled epilepsy without relevant comorbidity. This supports comorbidity and insufficient seizure control as major contributors of sleep disturbance in epilepsy.\n",

Overall, 10.9% of White, 37.8% of Filipina, and 17.8% of Black women had type 2 diabetes. Average sleep durations were 7.3, 6.3, and 6.6 h and napping durations were 16.8, 31.7, and 25.9 min for White, Filipina, and Black women, respectively. Sleep duration showed a significant (p < 0.01) nonlinear association with type 2 diabetes in Filipina women, with increased odds of diabetes at both low and high sleep durations independent of age, body mass index (body mass index), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein (high-density lipoprotein) ratio, hypertension, and daytime napping duration. Daytime napping duration was associated with type 2 diabetes only among White women; those napping >= 30 min/day had 74% (95% confidence interval (CI)= 10%, 175%) higher odds of diabetes compared to non-nappers independent of covariates including nighttime sleep duration. Results suggest ethnic-specific associations of nighttime sleep and daytime napping durations with type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Excessive daytime sleepiness and nighttime sleep quality in Thai patients with Parkinson's disease.  There were 36 females and 37 males with a mean (SD) age of 65.9 (9.1) years. All patients had a mean Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2.0 (range 0 to 4). EDS and poor nighttime sleep quality were found in 15.1% and 37% of patients, respectively. There was a significant difference in the mean Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total scores (p = 0.003) between patients and controls. The subset analysis of the components of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index revealed that sleep disturbance and the need of medication to sleep had significantly higher scores than those of controls. Twenty point five percent of patients had experienced sudden onset of sleep occurring during driving, meals, and working. Four point one percent ofpatient with sudden onset of sleep had had an accident. This study demonstrated a prevalence of EDS and poor nighttime sleep quality in Thai patients with Parkinson's disease. Screening for these two problems among Parkinson's disease patients should be considered in routine practice evaluations.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleeping problems in mothers and fathers of patients suffering from congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.  A comparison between the two groups showed that parents of patients had poorer sleep quality, greater sleepiness, and higher BDI-II scores compared to that of parents of healthy subjects (respectively, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score 6.5 vs 3.8, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score 6.2 vs 4.3, BDI-II score 8.4 vs 5.7). Specifically, mothers of patients showed poorer sleep quality and higher BDI-II scores compared to that of mothers of controls (respectively, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score 7.5 vs 3.8, BDI-II score 9.3 vs 5.9), whereas fathers of patients showed greater levels of sleepiness with respect to fathers of healthy children (respectively, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score 6.8 vs 4.0). These differences emerged in parents of younger children. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome impacts the family with different consequences for mothers and fathers. Indeed, while the patients' sleep is safeguarded, sleeping problems may occur in primary caregivers often associated with other psychological disorders. Specifically, this disease affects sleep quality and mood in the mothers and sleepiness levels in the fathers.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Is excessive daytime sleepiness a separate manifestation in Parkinson's disease? Excessive daytime sleepiness (Excessive daytime sleepiness) is common in Parkinson's disease (Parkinson's disease), but its role and relation to other Parkinson's disease features is less well understood. Among 114 persons with complete Epworth Sleepiness Scale data, significant independent associations were found between Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and axial/postural/gait impairment, depressive symptoms, and pain (R2, 0.199). Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores did not load significantly together with any other Parkinson's disease features in the Principal component analysis. Only a limited proportion of the variation in Excessive daytime sleepiness could be accounted for by other symptoms, and Excessive daytime sleepiness did not cluster together with any other Parkinson's disease features in Principal component analysiss. This suggests that Excessive daytime sleepiness is a separate manifestation differing from, for example, poor sleep quality and fatigue.\n",

ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01160874. The group mean (SD) Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was higher in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients (12.1 [4.4]) than in controls (6.0 [2.7]) (P < .001). On the basis of the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test scores, 14 patients (35%) were in the sleepy group, 20 (50%) were in the intermediate group, and only 6 (15%) were in the alert group. Sleepy attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients exhibited significantly deteriorated driving performance compared to the other 3 groups (P < .01). Our study shows that a significant proportion of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients exhibit an objective excessive daytime sleepiness, which, in addition, has an impact on simulated driving performance. Excessive daytime sleepiness, therefore, may be a key element needed to better evaluate these attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The relationship between driving simulation performance and obstructive sleep apnoea risk, daytime sleepiness, obesity and road traffic accident history of commercial drivers in Turkey. Driving performance is known to be very sensitive to cognitive-psychomotor impairment. The aim of the study was to determine the relationship between obesity, risk of obstructive sleep apnoea (obstructive sleep apnoea), daytime sleepiness, history of road traffic accident (road traffic accident) and performance on a driving simulator, among commercial drivers. A total of 282 commercial vehicle drivers were consecutively enrolled. The age range was 29-76 years. Thirty drivers were at high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea. Median ESS of the group was 2 (0-20). Forty-seven percent of the subjects at high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea failed in early reaction time test, while 28% of the drivers with low risk of obstructive sleep apnoea failed (p=0.03). The obese drivers failed the peripheral vision test when compared with non-obese drivers (p=0.02). ESS was higher for drivers with a history of road traffic accident when compared to those without road traffic accident (p=0.02). Cognitive-psychomotor functions can be impaired in obese and high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea patients. In our opinion, requiring obese and/or high risk of obstructive sleep apnoea drivers to take PTAS tests that assess driving skills and psychomotor-cognitive functions crucial to those skills would significantly improve road traffic safety, which is of considerable importance to public health.\n",

The simultaneous occurrence of metabolic syndrome and excessive daytime sleepiness are very common in obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) patients. Both conditions, if present in obstructive sleep apnea, have been reported to be associated with inflammation and disruption of oxidative stress balance that impair the cardiovascular system. To verify the impact of daytime sleepiness on inflammatory and oxidative stress markers, we evaluated obstructive sleep apnea patients without significant metabolic disturbance. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness presented increased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels even after controlling for confounders. No significant differences were found among the groups in paraoxonase-1 activity nor arylesterase activity of paraoxonase-1. AHI was independently associated and excessive daytime sleepiness tended to have an association with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In the absence of metabolic syndrome, increased inflammatory response was associated with AHI and daytime sleepiness, while obstructive sleep apnea was not associated with abnormalities in oxidative stress markers.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Natural history of excessive daytime sleepiness: role of obesity, weight loss, depression, and sleep propensity.  Full medical evaluation and 1-night polysomnographic at baseline and standardized telephone interview at follow-up. The incidence of Excessive daytime sleepiness was 8.2%, while its persistence and remission were 38% and 62%, respectively. Obesity and weight gain were associated with the incidence and persistence of Excessive daytime sleepiness, while weight loss was associated with its remission. Significant interactions between depression and polysomnographic parameters on incident Excessive daytime sleepiness showed that, in depressed individuals, incident Excessive daytime sleepiness was associated with sleep disturbances, while in non-depressed individuals, incident Excessive daytime sleepiness was associated with increased physiologic sleep propensity. Diabetes, allergy/ asthma, anemia, and sleep complaints also predicted the natural history of Excessive daytime sleepiness. Obesity, a disorder of epidemic proportions, is a major risk factor for the incidence and chronicity of Excessive daytime sleepiness, while weight loss is associated with its remission. Interestingly, objective sleep disturbances predict incident Excessive daytime sleepiness in depressed individuals, whereas physiologic sleep propensity predicts incident Excessive daytime sleepiness in those without depression. Weight management and treatment of depression and sleep disorders should be part of our public health policies.\n",

Among 86 patients randomized to sodium oxybate in GHB-2 and continued into GHB-3, 77.6% and 90.7% were excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy responders, respectively. The median (95% CI) times to first response were 37 (31-50) days for excessive daytime sleepiness and 25 (17-29) days for cataplexy, and median times to maximum response were 106 (85-164) days for excessive daytime sleepiness and 213 (94-279) days for cataplexy. GHB-3 results among 31 patients initially randomized to placebo were consistent with those treated with sodium oxybate throughout, but with longer times to maximum response. Response onset, assessed as clinically meaningful improvements in excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, was observed in most patients within 2 months; a longer period is needed to achieve maximum response.

      "Processing abstract: Narcolepsy with and without cataplexy, idiopathic hypersomnia with and without long sleep time: a cluster analysis. The successive editions of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (International Classification of Sleep Disorders) reflect the evolution of the concepts of various sleep disorders. This is particularly the case for central disorders of hypersomnolence, with continuous changes in terminology and divisions of narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and recurrent hypersomnia. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 2nd Edition (International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2), narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy with cataplexy), narcolepsy without cataplexy (narcolepsy without cataplexy), idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time (idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time), and idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time (idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time) are four, well-defined hypersomnias of central origin. However, in the absence of biological markers, doubts have been raised as to the relevance of a division of idiopathic hypersomnia into two forms, and it is not yet clear whether narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time are two distinct entities. With this in mind, it was decided to empirically review the International Classification of Sleep Disorders-2 classification by using a hierarchical cluster analysis to see whether this division has some relevance, even though the terms \"with long sleep time\" and \"without long sleep time\" are inappropriate. The cluster analysis differentiated three main clusters: Cluster 1, \"combined monosymptomatic hypersomnia/narcolepsy type 2\" (people initially diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time and narcolepsy without cataplexy); Cluster 2 \"polysymptomatic hypersomnia\" (people initially diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia with long sleep time); and Cluster 3, narcolepsy type 1 (people initially diagnosed with narcolepsy with cataplexy). Cluster analysis confirmed that narcolepsy type 1 and polysymptomatic hypersomnia are independent sleep disorders. People who were initially diagnosed with narcolepsy without cataplexy and idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time formed a single cluster, referred to as \"combined monosymptomatic hypersomnia/narcolepsy type 2.\"\n",

Among 166 referred patients, 120 had typical primary Kleine-Levin syndrome (syndrome secondary to brain diseases; n=4, atypical syndrome, n=7; differential diagnoses that were mostly psychiatric, n=29; incomplete information, n=6). The prevalence in France was 1.8 per million. The patients were often male (64%) and had more frequent birth and developmental abnormalities (45%) than controls (despite normal karyotypes), and most (80%) had teenage onset, with no difference between patients with prolonged (n=34) and short (n=85) episodes. In patients with prolonged episodes, the durations of the first episode (32+/-33 vs 11+/-6 days) and subsequent episodes were longer (mean episode duration=23+/-19 vs 10+/-3 days) and the disease course tended to be longer (9+/-6 vs 6+/-4 years). During episodes, patients with prolonged episodes had shorter sleep time, higher levels of anxiety, increased agitation, and more feelings of disembodiment and amnesia. Between episodes, they were more tired, needed more naps, fell asleep more rapidly, and had higher anxiety/depression scores. Mental disorders are frequent differential diagnoses of Kleine-Levin syndrome. One-third of patients have prolonged (>1 month) episodes with more frequent immediate and long-term consequences of the disease, prompting therapeutic trials.\n",

They also had shorter sleep latency and more sleep onset REM periods in Multiple Sleep Latency Test, but these results were strongly age-dependent. Actigraphy showed quantitatively less sleep and more sleep fragmentation than polysomnography. Regarding polysomnographic and actigraphic characteristics, there were no dramatic deviations between H1N1-vaccine-related and sporadic narcolepsy.

      "Processing abstract: Hypersomnia subtypes, sleep and relapse in bipolar disorder. Though poorly defined, hypersomnia is associated with negative health outcomes and new-onset and recurrence of psychiatric illness. Lack of definition impedes generalizability across studies. The present research clarifies hypersomnia diagnoses in bipolar disorder by exploring possible subgroups and their relationship to prospective sleep data and relapse into mood episodes. Factor analyses confirmed two separate subtypes of hypersomnia ('long sleep' and 'excessive sleepiness') that were uncorrelated. Latent profile analyses suggested a four-class solution, with 'long sleep' and 'excessive sleepiness' again representing two separate classes. Prospective sleep data suggested that the sleep of 'long sleepers' is characterized by a long time in bed, not long sleep duration. Longitudinal assessment suggested that 'excessive sleepiness' at baseline predicted mania/hypomania relapse. This study is the largest of hypersomnia to include objective sleep measurement, and refines our understanding of classification, characterization and associated morbidity. Hypersomnia appears to be comprised of two separate subgroups: long sleep and excessive sleepiness. Long sleep is characterized primarily by long bedrest duration. Excessive sleepiness is not associated with longer sleep or bedrest, but predicts relapse to mania/hypomania. Understanding these entities has important research and treatment implications.\n",

Regarding subjective sleep, 31% had excessive daytime sleepiness and 75% reported poor sleep quality. The polysomnography results revealed that Charcot-Marie-Tooth2 patients had an increase in stage N3 and a reduction in REM sleep, in addition to a high arousal index. Although 81% of the sample were snorers, only 13% had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 5. However, a positive correlation was found between the severity of disease and the AHI. Taken together, these data show that Charcot-Marie-Tooth2 disease is characterized by important changes in sleep architecture, probably due to sleep fragmentation. Although these alterations may worsen with disease severity, it seems that they are not related to sleep breathing or movement disorders.\n",

Narcolepsy results from immune-mediated destruction of hypocretin secreting neurons in hypothalamus, however the triggers and disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Vaccine-attributable risk of narcolepsy reported so far with the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccination Pandemrix has been manifold compared to the AS03 adjuvanted Arepanrix, which contained differently produced H1N1 viral antigen preparation. Hence, antigenic differences and antibody response to these vaccines were investigated. Increased circulating IgG-antibody levels to Pandemrix H1N1 antigen were found in 47 children with Pandemrix-associated narcolepsy when compared to 57 healthy children vaccinated with Pandemrix. H1N1 antigen of Arepanrix inhibited poorly these antibodies indicating antigenic difference between Arepanrix and Pandemrix. High-resolution gel electrophoresis quantitation and mass spectrometry identification analyses revealed higher amounts of structurally altered viral nucleoprotein (NP) in Pandemrix. Increased antibody levels to hemagglutinin (HA) and NP, particularly to detergent treated NP, was seen in narcolepsy. Higher levels of antibodies to NP were found in children with DQB1*06:02 risk allele and in DQB1*06:02 transgenic mice immunized with Pandemrix when compared to controls. This work identified 1) higher amounts of structurally altered viral NP in Pandemrix than in Arepanrix, 2) detergent-induced antigenic changes of viral NP, that are recognized by antibodies from children with narcolepsy, and 3) increased antibody response to NP in association of DQB1*06:02 risk allele of narcolepsy. These findings provide a link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy. Although detailed mechanisms of Pandemrix in narcolepsy remain elusive, our results move the focus from adjuvant(s) onto the H1N1 viral proteins.\n",

Erectile dysfunction (Erectile dysfunction) is frequent in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) and may act as a surrogate of endothelial dysfunction. Furthermore, impairments of vigilance and sustained attention are also commonly associated with obstructive sleep apnea. Three hundred eighty-one consecutive patients presenting for in-lab polysomnography were included in the analysis. Impaired erectile function was diagnosed in 246 patients (65%). With increasing impairment of erectile function, patients scored significantly worse in all vigilance test parameters and demonstrated more severely diminished vigilance (normal erectile function: 11.9%, moderately impaired erectile function: 24.1%, and severely impaired erectile function: 34.9%). Multivariate regression analyses including established risk factors for Erectile dysfunction, obstructive sleep apnea, or sleepiness revealed a significant independent association between lower scores for erectile function and impairments on the following vigilance test variables: odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for V-CR: 0.52 (0.34-0.81), CE: 0.87 (0.80-0.95), and V-RT: 0.91 (0.87-0.96). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale was independently associated with both measures of performance instability: odds ratio for V-CR: 6.94 (2.97-16.23) and V-RT: 1.28 (1.14-1.44). In obstructive sleep apnea patients, the severity of impaired erectile function was associated with impaired vigilance performance, independent of other known risk factors for Erectile dysfunction or obstructive sleep apnea and not mediated by sleepiness. Potentially, the findings suggest a direct relationship between vascular or endothelial dysfunction and impairments in both erectile function and neurobehavioral cognitive function.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The influences of task repetition, napping, time of day, and instruction on the Sustained Attention to Response Task. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (Sustained Attention to Response Task) helps to quantify vigilance impairments.Previous studies, in which five Sustained Attention to Response Task sessions on one day were administered, demonstrated worse performance during the first session than during the others. The present study comprises two experiments to identify a cause of this phenomenon. The average Sustained Attention to Response Task error count in Experiment 1 was 10.1; the median RT was 280 ms. Neither repetition nor napping influenced error count or RT. Time of day did not influence error count, but RT was significantly longer for morning than for afternoon Sustained Attention to Response Tasks. The additional participants in Experiment 2 had a 49% lower error count and a 14% higher RT than the participants in Experiment 1. Error counts reduced by 50% from the first to the second session of Experiment 2, irrespective of napping or time of day. Preferring accuracy over speed was associated with a significantly lower error count. The data suggest that a worse performance in the first Sustained Attention to Response Task session only occurs when instructing participants to prefer accuracy, which is caused by repetition, not by napping or time of day.\n",

They also exhibited more lifetime depressive episodes, were more often diagnosed as having bipolar disorder II and met more often bipolarity specifier criteria, with higher rates of bipolar temperaments and a higher bipolar disorder family loading. Among seasonal pattern(+) patients, 68.9% met the bipolarity specifier criteria, whereas 31.1% did not. Seasonality was not influenced by climatic conditions. The following independent variables were associated with seasonal pattern: bipolar disorder according to bipolarity specifier, female gender, comorbid bulimia nervosa, hypersomnia, number of depressive episodes and family history of substance abuse. Seasonal pattern is frequent among depressive patients attending primary care in France and may be indicative of hidden bipolarity.

We reported reversible changes in Cerebrospinalfluid hypothalamic biomarkers in a typical patient with Kleine-Levin syndrome that reinforces the hypothesis that in some patients Kleine-Levin syndrome episodes may be caused by recurrent functional alterations of the hypothalamus.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Challenging the validity of the association between oversleeping and overeating in atypical depression.  The one-month prevalence of major depressive episode was 6.1%, including a one-month prevalence of atypical depression of 1.6%, in this sample. Atypical depression subjects had a greater number of depressive symptoms and a longer duration of the current depressive episode than the other depressive subjects. Depressive subjects with hypersomnia slept longer (8h, 29min) than the other depressive subjects (6h, 36min) and longer than the subjects \"getting too much sleep\" (6h, 48min). Furthermore, hypersomnia was not associated with overeating while \"getting too much sleep\" showed a positive association with overeating. Hypersomnia needs to be evaluated using a strict definition. Otherwise, it leads to an overestimation of this symptom in major depressive episode subjects and to a false association with overeating.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Daytime sleepiness and EEG abnormalities in patients treated with second generation antipsychotic agents. The aim of this study was to verify whether or not an increased prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) or EEG abnormalities is observed in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (spectrum disorders), and to compare the effects of second generation antipsychotics (second generation antipsychotics) on patients' daytime sleepiness level and EEG recordings. A higher prevalence of abnormal EEG recordings was observed in spectrum disorders patients. No significant differences in average daytime sleepiness were found between patients with spectrum disorders and NPD; however, patients with spectrum disorders had longer sleep duration. Aripiprazole treatment was associated with significantly smaller and less frequent EEG abnormalities than treatment with any other second generation antipsychotics, while treatment with clozapine and olanzapine was related to an increased prevalence of severe EEG abnormalities. Patients with spectrum disorders treated with second generation antipsychotics in monotherapy were less sleepy than unmedicated patients with NPD. Although antipsychotics may have profound effects on EEG patients with schizophrenia do not have higher daytime sleepiness than patients with anxiety/personality disorders. Patients with schizophrenia may compensate sedative effects of antipsychotic treatment with sleep duration prolongation and report even less sleepiness than non-psychotic patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Are dysfunctional attitudes and beliefs about sleep unique to primary insomnia?  Compared to healthy controls, Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale scores were increased in primary insomnia, restless legs syndrome and restless legs syndrome+sleep apnea syndrome. There was a low correlation between Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale scores and polysomnographic variables, moderate correlations between Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale and subjective sleep parameters and Beck Depression Inventory scores (r=0.528), and a high correlation between Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale and the Regensburg Insomnia Scale score (r=0.603). The observation of increased Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale scores in other sleep disorders besides primary insomnia underscores the usefulness of a broadened diagnostic procedure and suggests that cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia modules may be a complementary treatment tool for these disorders.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Subjective deficits of attention, cognition and depression in patients with narcolepsy.  Patients rated their level of attention in everyday situations to be relatively poor. In an objective assessment of cognitive functioning, they showed only slight attention and executive function deficits. The subjective ratings of attention deficits significantly correlated with ratings of momentary sleepiness, anxiety, and depression, but not with objectively measured cognitive performance. Momentary sleepiness and depression predicted almost 39% of the variance in the ratings of subjectively perceived attention deficits. The present study showed that sleepiness and depression, more than objective cognitive deficits, might play a role in the subjectively perceived attention deficits of patients with narcolepsy. The results suggested that when counselling and treating patients with narcolepsy, clinicians should pay attention to potential depression because subjective cognitive complaints may not relate to objective cognitive impairments.\n",

To evaluate the compliance, benefits and side effects associated with continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) therapy among Pakistani patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) in private sector. Out of 135 patients who were prescribed continuous positive airway pressure therapy, 75 could be contacted. Sixty (80%) started using continuous positive airway pressure within one month of diagnosis and 46 (61%) continued to use it long-term (beyond one year). Compliance with continuous positive airway pressure therapy was associated with higher body mass index, higher Epworth sleepiness scale score, history of witnessed apnea, and reduction in daytime sleepiness with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. obstructive sleep apnea severity as assessed by apnea-hypopnea index did not affect compliance with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Use of anti-depressants and continuous positive airway pressure induced sleep disturbances were associated with poor compliance with continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Obesity, excessive daytime sleepiness, witnessed apnea and improvement of daytime symptoms following use of continuous positive airway pressure were predictors of improved compliance. Use of antidepressants and continuous positive airway pressure induced sleep disturbances were predictors of poor compliance.\n",

Of the 308 participants, 160 (51.9%) were male and 184 (43.1%) were female, with an average age of 48.67+/-13.31 years. Of all cases, 70.5% had viral hepatitis. The average Child-Pugh score was 5.9+/-1.2, and the average Model For End-Stage Liver Disease (Model For End-Stage Liver Disease) score was 10.2+/-3.2. The assessment tool comprised the following sub-items: itching, joint pain, abdominal pain, sleepiness, worry, appetite, depression, fear, jaundice, memory, personality, financial status, use of time, sexual desire, and sexual activity. For more than 50% of the patients, worry (68.8%), depression (65.3%), joint pain (62.3%), itch (56.5%), sleepiness (54.2%), memory problems (53.6), and sexual problems (50%) were present. The internal coefficient of consistency (Cronbach alpha coefficient) was 0.908, which indicates a very high level of consistency. The correlation coefficient for the intraobserver test/re-test reliability was 0.746 (p<0.000), which denotes a significant and good level of reliability. The construct validity between each sub-item of the tool and sub-items of Short Form-36 was assessed using Spearman's correlation test, which showed a weak to moderate correlation (<0.04 and 0.4-0.7) in the reverse direction. Our study findings provide supportive evidence of the reliability of the assessment tool. Its validity is similar to the original construct validity and was confirmed in our sample. Therefore, it was concluded that LDSI 2.0 was an appropriate tool for daily clinical use and research purposes. Simultaneous use of this life-quality assessment tool and Short Form-36 will enable a comprehensive but practical assessment of our patients.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The Epworth Sleepiness Scale in Portuguese adults: from classical measurement theory to Rasch model analysis. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) is a largely wide used scale for sleepiness assessment. Measurement properties are studied in a sample of Portuguese adults, using different statistical procedures. A principal component factor analysis was performed according to the CMT, revealing a single factor explaining 39.92% of the total variance of the scale. Internal consistency measured by Cronbach's alpha coefficient was of .77. The mean of inter-item correlation was of .31 (.05<r>.47), whereas the item-total correlations were considered good (.46<r>.73). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale total score for OSA patients was significantly higher than healthy participants (p<.05). Overall data from the RM analysis was consistent with the guidelines of Linacre and essential unidimensionality was empirically corroborated (61% the percentage of variance explained by the Rasch analysis). Model fit is adequate and the reliability coefficients for both items (.99) and subjects (.78) were considered good. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was also satisfactory (.78). The Epworth Sleepiness Scale showed an adequate structural, internal, and criterion validity, both in the CMT and the RM, suggesting this as a useful and effective measure for assessing sleepiness in Portuguese adults.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Self-reported sleep lengths >= 9 hours among Swedish patients with stress-related exhaustion: Associations with depression, quality of sleep and levels of fatigue. Insomnia-type sleep disturbances are frequent among patients suffering from stress-related exhaustion disorder. However, clinical observations indicate that a subgroup suffer from sleep lengths frequently exceeding 9 hours, coupled with great daytime sleepiness. Univariate analyses showed that patients in the \"mostly/always >= 9 hours\" group were more often on sick leave, and reported more depression and fatigue, better sleep quality and more daytime sleepiness, than patients in the other groups. Multivariate analyses showed that these patients scored higher on measures of fatigue than the rest of the sample independently of gender, use of antidepressants, sick leave, depression and quality of sleep. Patients suffering from exhaustion disorder and reporting excessive sleep seem to have a generally poorer clinical picture but better quality of sleep than their counterparts with shorter sleep lengths. The mechanisms underlying these differences, together with their prognostic value and implications for treatment remain to be elucidated in future studies.\n",

A significantly higher prevalence of restless legs syndrome (P<0.0005; odds ratio 21.5; 95% confidence interval 8.17-57) was found in post polio syndrome patients (post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome+ 63.6%) than in healthy controls (7.5%). The Fatigue Severity Scale score was higher in post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome+ than in post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome- patients (P=0.03). A significant decrease of SF-36 scores, including the physical function (P=0.001), physical role (P=0.0001) and bodily pain (P=0.03) domains, was found in post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome+ versus post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome- patients. Finally, it was found that post polio syndrome/restless legs syndrome+ showed a significant correlation between International Restless Legs Scale score and Fatigue Severity Scale (P<0.0001), as well as between International Restless Legs Scale score and most of the SF-36 items (physical role P=0.0018, general health P=0.0009, vitality P=0.0022, social functioning P=0.002, role emotional P=0.0019, and mental health P=0.0003). Our findings demonstrate a high prevalence of restless legs syndrome in post polio syndrome, and that restless legs syndrome occurrence may significantly influence the health-related quality of life and fatigue of post polio syndrome patients. A hypothetical link between neuroanatomical and inflammatory mechanisms in restless legs syndrome and post polio syndrome is suggested.\n",

As required by the inclusion criteria, all patients had Epworth Sleepiness Scale (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) scores >10. The mean sleep latency in the mild sleepiness in an objective sleepiness test indicated mild objective sleepiness in non-organic hypersomnia (8.1 +/- 4.0 min) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (7.2 +/- 4.1 min), but more severe sleepiness in narcolepsy (2.5 +/- 2.0 min). The difference between narcolepsy and the other two groups was significant; the difference between non-organic hypersomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome was not. In the Steer Clear performance test, non-organic hypersomnia patients performed worst (error rate = 10.4%) followed by narcolepsy (8.0%) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients (5.9%; p = 0.008). The difference between obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome and the other two groups was significant, but not between non-organic hypersomnia and narcolepsy. The pupillary unrest index was found to be highest in narcolepsy (11.5) followed by non-organic hypersomnia (9.2) and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (7.4; n.s.). A high error rate in the Steer Clear performance test along with mild sleepiness in an objective sleepiness test (mild sleepiness in an objective sleepiness test) in a patient with subjective sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) is suggestive of non-organic hypersomnia. This disproportionately high error rate in non-organic hypersomnia may be caused by factors unrelated to sleep pressure, such as anergia, reduced attention and motivation affecting performance, but not conventional sleepiness measurements.\n",

Excessive daytime sleepiness defined as Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >10 was reported in 66.7% of patients and 6.7% of controls. The temporal pattern of sleep latencies in individual Multiple Sleep Latency Test trials differed between patients and controls, with progressive increased sleep latency in patients across the trials in contrast to a \"U curve\" for controls. We did not find between-group differences regarding the mean sleep latency on the 5 Multiple Sleep Latency Test trials, but did observe reduced sleep latencies in patients for the first 2 trials. Despite increased slow-wave sleep disruptions found in patients (i.e, more micro-arousals and hypersynchronous high-voltage delta waves arousals), we did not find polysomnographic characteristic differences when comparing sleepy patients for either subjective or objective daytime sleepiness on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test compared with alert patients. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a common complaint in subjects with SW or sleep terrors and shorter sleep latencies in the early morning hours. Despite an increased slow-wave sleep fragmentation found in these patients, we did not identify any association with the level of daytime sleepiness.\n",

Previous studies revealed significant associations between obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome-related symptoms and obstructive airway diseases in the general population. However, other studies showed that the frequency of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome-related symptoms in patients with obstructive airway diseases decreases after the age of 60 and older.

The prevalence rates of frequent snoring, breathing pauses, and EDS were 28.1%, 12.9%, and 11.6%, respectively. However, participants with airflow limitation were less likely to report breathing pauses, frequent snoring, EDS, and obesity. Finally, frequent snoring was significantly more common in males than females.

There were 54.8% of the narcolepsy with cataplexy patients who had an nocturnal sleep onset rapid eye movement sleep period, but only 2.4% of all other patients had an nocturnal sleep onset rapid eye movement sleep period. The specificity of an nocturnal sleep onset rapid eye movement sleep period for detection of narcolepsy with cataplexy was high at 97.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.2-99.4%), but the sensitivity was moderate at 54.8% (95% CI: 38.7-70.2%). Overall, the positive predictive value of an nocturnal sleep onset rapid eye movement sleep period for the diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy was 88.5% (95% CI: 69.8-97.4%).

The cognitive assessment profile was similar in both groups and showed normal results for mean full-scale IQ and perceptual speed but decreased verbal comprehension and working memory. Patients with psychiatric comorbidity had a significantly lower full-scale IQ compared to those without. Our study indicates increased psychiatric comorbidity in children and adolescents with narcolepsy. The identified cognitive profile with significantly lower verbal comprehension and working memory compared with the normal mean index could have important implications for social relations and schooling.

Among these patients, 70 had a first-ever narcolepsy diagnosis code after vaccination, of which 16 had a chart-confirmed incident diagnosis of narcolepsy. None had their symptom onset during the 180 days after receipt of a 2009 pandemic vaccine compared with 6.52 expected, and 2 had onset after a 2010-2011 seasonal vaccine compared with 8.83 expected. Influenza vaccines containing the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strain used in the United States were not associated with an increased risk of narcolepsy. Vaccination with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine viral antigens does not appear to be sufficient by itself to increase the incidence of narcolepsy in a population.\n",

Multiple Unprepared Reaction Time Test values above 250 ms can be considered abnormal. The Oxford Sleep Resistance test error index (the number of all errors divided by the duration of the session in hours) correlated statistically significantly with sleep latency, Multiple Unprepared Reaction Time Test time, and ESS. Treatment improved Oxford Sleep Resistance test sleep latency from 33 min 4 s to 36 min 48 s, Oxford Sleep Resistance test error index from 66/h to 26/h, and Multiple Unprepared Reaction Time Test time from 278 ms to 224 ms; these differences were statistically significant. Oxford Sleep Resistance test and Multiple Unprepared Reaction Time Test tests are practical and reliable tools for measuring improvement in vigilance due to sleep apnea therapy in professional drivers.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness in pregnancy and the role of socio-demographic factors: comparing pregnant women with women in the general population.  After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30min less total sleep time than women in the general population. The distribution of total sleep time was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (<=6h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness). Pregnant women>30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in total sleep time. Identifying as Maori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. excessive daytime sleepiness also more likely occurred among Maori women and women who worked at night. Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are also higher among Maori than non-Maori women and those who do night work. Health professionals responsible for the care of pregnant women need to be well-educated about the importance of sleep and discuss sleep issues with the women they care for.\n",

Our objective was to investigate to what extent the Clinical Interview for Depression (Clinical Interview for Depression) used in the general practice setting covers clinically valid subscales (depression, anxiety, and apathy) which can measure outcome of antidepressant therapy as well as identifying subsyndromes within major depressive disorder. The Clinical Interview for Depression was compared to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17). Whereas the HAM-D17 was found not to have an acceptable scalability, the three brief Clinical Interview for Depression subscales for depression (six items), anxiety (five items), and apathy (five items) all had an acceptable scalability. Within the major depressive symptoms, principal component analysis identified the Clinical Interview for Depression items of hypersomnia, increased appetite or weight gain as defining the subsyndrome of atypical depression. In total 29 patients (approximately 20%) had an atypical depression. The samples were derived from a single study and were all rated by a single rater.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Is nocturnal epilepsy cause of disturbed quality of sleep and elevated daytime sleepiness? Nocturnal seizures are an important type of epilepsy. They can result in morbidity due to disruption of sleep architecture. Daytime sleepiness, as a serious consequence of nocturnal seizures, has negative influence on quality of life in patients with epilepsy. Overnight video-EEG-polysomnography detected significant changes in the sleep architecture in patients with nocturnal epilepsy. Significant decrease of N3 stage of NREM sleep (14.31%+/-8.07 in the group of nocturnal epilepsy vs. 20.12%+/-9.24 in the group of daytime epilepsy, p=0.01). Concurrently, significantly poorer sleep quality according to Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (18.52+/-7.51 in the group of nocturnal epilepsy vs. 6.21+/-3.62 in the group of daytime epilepsy, p=0.01) and tendency to increased daytime sleepiness according to Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire was revealed in these patients. Remarkable changes in sleep architecture associated with poor quality of sleep and increased daytime sleepiness were detected in patients with nocturnal epilepsy. In conclusion, we emphasize the importance of sleep history taking in patients with epilepsy and their further evaluation in sleep laboratory.\n",

An association between an adjuvanted (AS03) A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine and narcolepsy has been reported in Europe. A total of 24 cases were included and overall incidence rate was 1.5 per million person-years. A cluster of 7 cases was observed among vaccinated persons in the winter 2009-2010. In the primary cohort analysis, 16-week post-vaccination RR was 4.32 (95% CI: 1.50-11.12). RR was 2.07 (0.70-6.17) in the self-controlled case series, and 1.48 (0.37-7.03) using the case-control method. Estimates were lower when observation was restricted to the period of pandemic influenza circulation, and tended to be higher in persons <20 years old and for cataplexy cases. Results are compatible with an excess risk of approximately one case per million vaccine doses, mainly in persons less than 20 years of age. However, a confounding effect of the influenza infection cannot be ruled out.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Relationship between habitual sleep duration, obesity and depressive symptoms in patients with sleep apnoea.  obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (apnoea-hypopnoea index>5/h plus symptoms) was diagnosed in 75.7% of the patients. Their sleep duration correlated negatively with psychological distress (r=-0.22, p=0.043) and depressive symptoms (r=-0.27, p=0.013) in men. No association was found between self-reported habitual sleep duration and measures of obesity or subjective sleepiness. In patients considered for CPAP therapy, sleep duration associated inversely with depressive symptoms both in men (r=-0.28, p=0.024) and women (r=-0.33, p=0.037). After adjusting for age and Epworth Sleepiness Score, the results remained essentially similar. Our results suggest that self-reported habitual sleep duration does not associate with obesity in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Shorter habitual sleep duration seems to associate with higher scores of depressive symptoms and psychological distress.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Sleep habits in adolescents of Saudi Arabia; distinct patterns and extreme sleep schedules.  Students slept an average of 7.0 hours on school nights, with an average delay of 2.8 and 6.0 hours in weekend sleep and rise times, respectively. Around 1 in 10 students stayed up all night and slept after returning from school (exhibiting a reversed sleep cycle) on weeknights. This pattern was more prevalent among boys and students with lower grade point averages. The prevalence of sleep disturbance was 65%, and excessive daytime sleepiness was found in 37% of the students. Predictors of excessive daytime sleepiness were school type, stress, napping and caffeine use, while gender was a predictor of disturbed sleep. Adolescents in Saudi Arabia showed a high percentage of poor sleep quality. Compared with adolescents from other countries, they had a larger delay in weekend sleep and rise times. An alarming reversed sleep cycle on weekdays is present and highlights the need for further assessment.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Comparison of cardiovascular co-morbidities and continuous positive airway pressure use in patients with positional and non-positional mild obstructive sleep apnea. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine if there are differences in cardiovascular co-morbidities, blood pressure (blood pressure) and continuous positive airway pressure (continuous positive airway pressure) use between patients with positional-dependent and nonpositional-dependent obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea). Demographic and anthropometric variables showed non-positional severe obstructive sleep apnea had poor sleep quality and higher morning blood pressures. Positional mild obstructive sleep apnea had the lowest cardiovascular co-morbidities. Overall continuous positive airway pressure acceptance was 45.6%. Mild obstructive sleep apnea patients had the lowest continuous positive airway pressure acceptance rate (10%), followed by moderate group (37.37%) and severe group (61.88%, P < 0.001). However, the significant difference in continuous positive airway pressure acceptance across obstructive sleep apnea severity disappeared when the data was stratified by positional dependency. This study found that positional mild obstructive sleep apnea had less cardiovascular co-morbidities compared with subjects with positional severe obstructive sleep apnea. Independent of posture, continuous positive airway pressure acceptance in patients with mild obstructive sleep apnea was low, but continuous positive airway pressure compliance was similar in continuous positive airway pressure acceptors regardless of posture dependency of obstructive sleep apnea. Since there are increasing evidences of greater cardiovascular risk for untreated mild obstructive sleep apnea, improving continuous positive airway pressure acceptance among mild obstructive sleep apnea patients may be clinically important regardless of posture dependency.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Mechanisms of rapid eye movement sleep in health and disease.  A complex interaction between brainstem rapid eye movement sleep core circuits and forebrain and hypothalamic structures is necessary to generate rapid eye movement sleep. Cholinergic activation and GABAergic inhibition trigger the activation of subcoeruleus neurons, which form the core of the rapid eye movement sleep circuit. Untimely activation of rapid eye movement sleep circuits leads to cataplexy - involuntary muscle weakness or paralysis - a major symptom of narcolepsy. Degeneration of the rapid eye movement circuit is associated with excessive muscle activation in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Inappropriate arousal from sleep during obstructive sleep apnea repeatedly disturbs the activity of sleep circuits, particularly the rapid eye movement sleep circuit.\n",

Classic narcolepsy markers DQB1*06:02 and low CSF hypocretin-1 were found in 87.4% of cases with cataplexy, and in 20.0% without cataplexy. Nine cases (all with cataplexy) were DQB1*06:02 negative with low CSF hypocretin-1, constituting 1.7% [0.8%-3.4%] of all cases with cataplexy and 1.8% [0.8%-3.4%] of cases with low CSF hypocretin independent of cataplexy across sites. Five HLA negative subjects had severe cataplexy, often occurring without clear triggers. Subjects had diverse ethnic backgrounds and HLA alleles at all loci, suggesting no single secondary HLA association. The rare subtype DPB1*0901, and homologous DPB1*10:01 subtype, were present in 5 subjects, suggesting a secondary association with HLA-DP. Preprohypocretin sequencing revealed no mutations beyond one previously reported in a very early onset case. No new MOG or DNMT1 mutations were found, nor were suspicious or private variants in novel genes identified through exome sequencing. Hypocretin, MOG, or DNMT1 mutations are exceptional findings in DQB1*06:02 negative cases with hypocretin deficiency. A secondary HLA-DP association may be present in these cases.

We sought to determine prevalence and predictors of excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with severe obesity with a body mass index (body mass index) >35kg/m(2) and obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) with an apnea-hypopnea index >15/h. A total of 123 of 245 study patients (50.2%) had an ESS >=11. Patients with an ESS >=11 were younger and less often unemployed or retired compared with patients with an ESS <11. Polysomnography revealed a longer total sleep time (TST), higher sleep efficiency, and shorter sleep latency in patients with ESS >=11. In addition, obstructive apneas during TST as well as oxygen saturations <80% occurred significantly more often in patients with versus without an ESS >=11. Improvement of daytime sleepiness after initiation of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy occurred more often in patients with versus without ESS >=11 (93 versus 73%, p<0.01). Obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness are characterized by younger age, longer TSTs, more frequent obstructive apneas, and oxygen desaturations <80% compared with patients without excessive daytime sleepiness. Excessive daytime sleepiness can be improved in more than 90% of patients using CPAP therapy.\n",

Hypocretin deficiency appears to underlie narcolepsy with cataplexy, and infections and vaccinations have been associated with disease onset. Targeted therapeutic approaches are currently underway. A putative naturally occurring constituent in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with non-narcoleptic primary hypersomnias, able to stimulate gamma-aminobutyric acid alpha receptors and induce sleep, has recently been postulated. Neuroimaging has also provided more insight into the pathophysiology of Kleine-Levin syndrome. Sleep deprivation is currently recognized as a major differential diagnosis. Excessive daytime sleepiness is the cardinal symptom of the hypersomnias of central origin, with major impact on the quality of life. It is important that clinicians be able to recognize these conditions, so that appropriate management or onward referral is expedited.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Dual cases of type 1 narcolepsy with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  Ten cases were identified, one with schizoaffective disorder, one with delusional disorder, two with schizophreniform disorder, and 6 with schizophrenia. In all cases, narcolepsy manifested first in childhood or adolescence, followed by psychotic symptoms after a variable interval. These patients had auditory hallucinations, which was the most differentiating clinical feature in comparison to narcolepsy patients without psychosis. Narcolepsy therapy may have played a role in triggering psychotic symptoms but these did not reverse with changes in narcolepsy medications. Response to antipsychotic treatment was variable. Pathophysiological studies did not reveal any known autoantibodies or unusual brain immunostaining pattern. No strong HLA association outside of HLA DQB1*06:02 was found, although increased DRB3*03 and DPA1*02:01 was notable. Narcolepsy can occur in association with schizophrenia, with significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Dual cases maybe under diagnosed, as onset is unusually early, often in childhood. Narcolepsy and psychosis may share an autoimmune pathology; thus, further investigations in larger samples are warranted.\n",

Among the completed surveys, 898 (37.8%) screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea, 746 (31.6%) for moderate to severe insomnia, and 866 (36.8%) for restless legs syndrome. In contrast, only 4%, 11%, and 12% of the cohort reported being diagnosed by a health care provider with obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, respectively. Excessive daytime sleepiness was noted in 30% of respondents based on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. More than 60% of the respondents reported an abnormal level of fatigue based on the Fatigue Severity Scale. Both abnormal fatigue and sleepiness scores were associated with screening positive for obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome. A significant percentage of Multiple Sclerosis subjects in our sample screened positive for one or more sleep disorders. The vast majority of these sleep disorders were undiagnosed.

By analyzing miRNA in plasma with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction we identified 50, 24, and 6 MicroRNAs that were different in patients with type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy, and idiopathic hypersomnia, respectively, compared with healthy controls. Twenty miRNA candidates who fulfilled the criteria of at least two-fold difference and p-value < 0.05 were selected to validate the miRNA changes in an independent cohort of patients. Four MicroRNAs differed significantly between type 1 narcolepsy patients and healthy controls. Levels of miR-30c, let-7f, and miR-26a were higher, whereas the level of miR-130a was lower in type 1 narcolepsy than healthy controls. The miRNA differences were not specific for type 1 narcolepsy, since the levels of the four MicroRNAs were also altered in patients with type 2 narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia compared with healthy controls. The levels of four MicroRNAs differed in plasma from patients with type 1 narcolepsy, type 2 narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia suggesting that alterations of MicroRNAs may be involved in the pathophysiology of central hypersomnias.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Variations in sleep characteristics and sleep-related impairment in at-risk college drinkers: a latent profile analysis.  Four classes best described the sleep and sleep-related consequences of at-risk college drinkers. Classes represented different gradients and types of sleep patterns and sleep-related impairment; nearly half the sample reported late bedtimes and daytime consequences of insufficient sleep. Subsequent validation analyses indicated that these classes were directly correspondent with severity of alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences illicit substance use, and perceived health. These findings indicate the presence of significant heterogeneity in college drinkers' sleep patterns and experiences of sleep-related impairment. Class differences significantly impact the level of alcohol and drug use and the consequences members experience. Greater alcohol use and sleep/wake problems are associated with increased risk for negative consequences for certain classes. These results suggest that college drinking interventions could benefit from the incorporation of sleep-related content and the value in adding brief alcohol assessments and interventions to other college health treatments.\n",

However, the sedation effects of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists have limited their wider application in acute stroke patients due to the potential risk of stupor. We included five trials with 3838 patients. The methodological quality of the included trials was generally good, with low risk of bias. Four trials measured death and dependency at three months in chlormethiazole versus placebo without significant difference (risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.11). One trial measured this outcome between diazepam and placebo (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.07). In the subgroup analysis of total anterior circulation syndrome (total anterior circulation syndrome), a higher percentage of functional independence was found in the chlormethiazole group (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.64). The frequent adverse events related to chlormethiazole were somnolence (RR 4.56, 95% CI 3.50 to 5.95) and rhinitis (RR 4.75, 95% CI 2.67 to 8.46). This review does not provide the evidence to support the use of Gamma aminobutyric acid receptor agonists (chlormethiazole or diazepam) for the treatment of patients with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. Chlormethiazole appeared to be beneficial in improving functional independence in patients with total anterior circulation syndrome according to the subgroup analysis, but this result must be interpreted with great caution. More well-designed randomized controlled trials with large samples of total anterior circulation syndrome would be required for further confirmation.

This study was designed to assess the prevalence and the correlate factors of frequent nocturnal awakening (frequent nocturnal awakening) among Chinese school-aged children. Furthermore, the associations of frequent nocturnal awakening with subjective sleep perception and daytime sleepiness were examined. The prevalence of frequent nocturnal awakening was 9.8% (10.0% for boys vs. 8.9% for girls) in our sampled children. The prominent frequent nocturnal awakening-related factors inclued biological health problems, such as overweight/obesity (OR = 1.70), chronic pain during night (OR = 2.47), and chronic respiratory condition (OR = 1.23), poor psychosocial condition, such as poor mental and emotional functioning (OR = 1.34), poor sleep hygiene, such as frequently doing exciting activities before bedtime (OR = 1.24) and bedtime resistance (OR = 1.42), and parents' history of insomnia (OR = 1.31). frequent nocturnal awakening was associated with subjective poor sleep quality (OR = 1.24), subjective insufficient sleep (OR = 1.21), and daytime sleepiness (OR = 1.35). frequent nocturnal awakening was associated with poor sleep and daytime sleepiness. Compared to sleep environment and family susceptibility, chronic health problems, poor psychosocial condition, and poor sleep hygiene had greater impact on frequent nocturnal awakening, indicating childhood frequent nocturnal awakening could be partly prevented by health promotion, by psychological intervention, and by improving sleep hygiene routine.\n",

At 6 months, the intervention group had 10% more participants with continuous positive airway pressure usage >=4 h, significantly higher adherence as compared to controls (5+/-1.8 h vs 4.3+/-1.7, p=0.031), mean: 0.7 h/day and fewer discontinuations of continuous positive airway pressure. A multiple linear regression model showed that intervention group and daytime sleepiness were variables independently associated with treatment adherence. An inexpensive basic intervention involving communication of sleep test results and the importance of continuous positive airway pressure adherence improves adherence to continuous positive airway pressure therapy. In addition, greater daytime sleepiness is associated with higher continuous positive airway pressure adherence.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The prevalence and characteristics associated with excessive daytime sleepiness among Australian workers.  In this population of adult employees (40.0% male; mean age 40.2 +/- 10.4 years), prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness was 16.0%. Characteristics associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were age, higher body mass index, markers of poorer diet, and markers of poorer mental health. Excessive daytime sleepiness is potentially an important contributor to lower productivity and poorer mental health in the workplace. Our finding suggests that workplace health programs aimed at improving diet and body weight may also help alleviate excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",

Seventy-five patients with narcolepsy were identified (43 males, 32 females; mean age at onset 10y 4mo, range 3-18y). Of these patients, 11 received the Pandemrix vaccine before narcolepsy onset. On first presentation, there were more frequent reports of cataplexy, among other features, in vaccinated than in unvaccinated patients (82% vs 55%), but only excessive weight gain (55% vs 20%) was significantly more frequent (p=0.03). Facial hypotonia (p=0.03) and tongue protrusion (p=0.01) were eventually seen more frequently in vaccinated children. When considering patients diagnosed within a year of onset, vaccinated children were not diagnosed more rapidly than unvaccinated children. Some symptoms and signs of narcolepsy were more frequently reported in Pandemrix-vaccinated patients. There was no evidence of the more rapid diagnosis in vaccinated patients that has been reported in Finland and Sweden.\n",

      "Processing abstract: U-shaped associations between time in bed and the physical and mental functioning of Japanese civil servants: the roles of work, family, behavioral and sleep quality characteristics.  High job demands, long work hours, and high work-family conflict were more prevalent among those with short time in bed. Those with long time in bed had daily drinking habits. Whereas those with short time in bed had poor sleep, mainly due to poor subjective sleep quality and daytime dysfunction, those with long time in bed had poor sleep, mainly due to long sleep latency, poor sleep efficiency and sleep disturbances. The U-shaped associations between time in bed and poor physical and mental health, with the best health observed in those spending ~8h in bed, weakened considerably after adjustment for sleep quality, followed by work and family characteristics. After adjusting for behavioral characteristics and long-standing illnesses, the associations hardly changed. The U-shaped associations between time in bed and health may be explained by U-shaped associations between time in bed and poor sleep and psychosocial stress in work and family life.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Clinical features associated with sleep disturbances in Parkinson's disease.  pREM sleep behavior disorder was present in 38% and excessive daytime sleepiness was present in 29% of the patients. As opposed to excessive daytime sleepiness, pREM sleep behavior disorder showed no association to disease duration or severity. Parkinson's disease patients with pREM sleep behavior disorder reported more cognitive problems. There was a trend towards more autonomic dysfunction in patients with pREM sleep behavior disorder. Nocturia and sleep fragmentation were the most frequent general sleep problems reported by the patients. Our results suggest that excessive daytime sleepiness is related to disease duration, and possibly caused by progressive neurodegeneration. pREM sleep behavior disorder seems to be a distinct feature present in only a proportion of Parkinson's disease patients.\n",

Working on shifts, especially on a night shift, influences the endogenous sleep regulation system leading to diminished sleep time and increased somnolence. We attempted to evaluate the impact of shifts on sleepiness and correlate the sleepiness score to the experience in a shift schedule. Statistical analysis revealed that workers of lower Epworth had a mean age of 43.6 years, compared to the mean age of 36.4 years of workers with higher Epworth. Furthermore, workers of lower Epworth were characterized by a mean number of shift years equal to 14.8, while those of higher Epworth possessed a mean number of shift years equal to 8. The shift schedule did not reveal any statistically significant correlation. Workers employed for a longer time had diminished sleepiness. However, there is no relationship between night shifts and sleepiness, possibly because of exposure to artificial lighting in the construction site.\n",

Forty-four patients received piribedil; 36 continued on either pramipexole or ropinirole. There was no difference in the primary end point reaction time of the Test battery for Attention Performances subtest vigilance between piribedil and the comparator (996 vs 954 milliseconds, P = 0.68). Piribedil reduced daytime sleepiness with lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores at the end of treatment compared with the comparator (-4 vs -2 points; P = 0.01). The median Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score at the end of treatment was comparable between the 2 groups. Neuropsychological tests revealed no significant between-treatment differences. A higher therapeutic effect and global improvement were shown by the Clinical Global Impression of piribedil-treated patients. This study shows that switching from pramipexole or ropinirole to piribedil has no effect on the reaction time of the Test battery for Attention Performances subtest vigilance but upholds the same therapeutic motor effect and reduces daytime sleepiness to a clinically relevant degree in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",

      "Processing abstract: A longitudinal study of insomnia and other sleep complaints in adolescents with and without alcohol use disorders. Sleep disturbances are both common and well-characterized in adults with alcohol use disorders (alcohol use disorders), but have received little study in adolescents with alcohol use disorders. Furthermore, a handful of studies suggest that sleep complaints are a risk factor for alcohol use disorders. However, no published studies have yet examined the longitudinal course of sleep complaints in adolescents with alcohol use disorders; in particular, it remains unclear how persistent AUD-associated sleep complaints are in this age group, and what types of sleep complaints are most relevant to alcohol-use symptoms. We investigated these questions in a 5-year longitudinal study of adolescents with and without alcohol use disorders at baseline. The AUD+ group reported more overall sleep disturbance at baseline, including greater insomnia and hypersomnia complaints, and greater variability in weekday-weekend sleep duration. Group differences in insomnia and hypersomnia complaints persisted to the 5- and 3-year follow-ups, respectively. In the AUD- group, greater insomnia complaints at baseline predicted an increase in alcohol symptoms at the 1-year follow-up, while greater variability in sleep duration at baseline predicted an increase in alcohol symptoms at the 3- and 5-year follow-ups. These results complement previous findings in other samples, indicating that insomnia and other sleep problems are a chronic predicament for adolescents with alcohol use disorders. The findings also suggest that sleep disturbances may place adolescents without alcohol use disorders at an elevated risk of developing alcohol problems.\n",

Further analyses with Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the overall reaction time and multiple sleep latency test latency in insomniacs (r=-0.444, p<0.01), whereas no such correlation was found in controls. Results suggest that primary insomnia patients do show executive control function deficits compared with good sleep controls.

Recent findings reinforce the ubiquity of insufficient and poor-quality sleep in teens and their consequences on physical and mental health, cognition, and behavior. Increasing use of technology by teens, especially at night, plays a growing role in this. Parentally set bedtimes can be effective in increasing the sleep duration, thereby diminishing the consequences of insufficient sleep. Parasomnias, common in early childhood, usually diminish with the transition into adolescence. An almost 10-fold increase in the incidence of narcolepsy has been reported following the use of one type of vaccination against influenza H1N1 in Europe.

      "Processing abstract: Definitions of sleeplessness in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder): implications for mothers' mental state, daytime sleepiness and sleep-related cognitions. Sleep disturbances are common in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). Sleeplessness is frequently reported although results are inconsistent perhaps because different definitions for it are applied. This study looked at maternal functioning and child objective sleep patterns in relation to different definitions of sleeplessness in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Both definitions appeared to tap similar although slightly different constructs. There were no group differences in objective sleep patterns. Maternal mental health was found to be significantly worse in the mothers who considered their child to be sleepless (MD) (P < 0.025), but not in those mothers whose child was found to be sleepless according to the standardized criteria (QD). Maternal sleepiness did not differ between groups. For both categories of sleepless children (MD and QD), the mothers had significantly more doubts about their competency as a parent (P < 0.01 and P < 0.025, respectively) compared to mothers of children without sleeplessness. Two different maternal assessments of child sleeplessness in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder may assess subtly different constructs, but both may provide useful information about potential problems across the family.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Quality of life in children with narcolepsy.  The cohort included 69 control subjects (29 boys) and 117 patients (69 control subjects (29 boys) and 117 patients; 59 de novo patients). Cataplexy was present in 81% and DQB1*0602 was positive in 91%. The control children were older (13.5+/-3.2 vs. 11.6+/-3.1 years, P<0.001) and less obese (1.4% vs. 60%, P<0.001). Twenty-five percent of the patients and 15.6% of the control subjects had clinically significant depressive feelings on Children's Depression Inventory (CDI>=16) (NS). Fifty-three narcoleptic and 43 control adolescents, 31 narcoleptic children and 23 control children filled out the health-related quality of life questionnaires as well as 83 parents of patients and 60 parents of control subjects. Narcolepsy seriously impacts health-related quality of life in terms of vitality, physical well-being, relations with friends and leisure activities, especially in adolescents. Depression was the factor that most affected health-related quality of life in both narcoleptic and control subjects. For the control subjects and the narcoleptic patients, when the CDI score was entered into the multivariable regression model adjusted for gender and age, no other continuous independent variable could significantly increase the likelihood of the model. When the CDI score increased by 1, the mean health-related quality of life score decreased by 1.7 for narcoleptic patients and 1.5 for control subjects. Apnea-hypopnoea index, diagnosis delay, disease duration, obesity, the presence of cataplexy or treatment had no effects on health-related quality of life. Narcoleptic children and adolescents were at high risk for poor health-related quality of life. Depressive symptoms had a major impact on health-related quality of life. We recommend a more thorough assessment and management of psychological health in this population.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Hypercapnia is a key correlate of EEG activation and daytime sleepiness in hypercapnic sleep disordered breathing patients. The key determinants of daytime drowsiness in sleep disordered breathing (sleep disordered breathing) are unclear. Hypercapnia has not been examined as a potential contributor due to the lack of reliable measurement during sleep. To overcome this limitation, we studied predominantly hypercapnic sleep disordered breathing patients to investigate the role of hypercapnia on EEG activation and daytime sleepiness. After the PAP treatment, these patients showed a significant decrease in their waking pCO(2), daytime sleepiness, as well as all key breathing/oxygenation parameters during sleep. Overnight Delta/Alpha ratio of EEG was significantly reduced. There is a significant cross-correlation between a reduced wake pCO(2), a faster (more activated) sleep EEG (reduced Delta/Alpha ratio) and reduced daytime sleepiness (all p < 0.05) with PAP treatment. Multiple regression analyses showed the degree of change in hypercapnia to be the only significant predictor for both ESS and Delta/ Alpha ratio. Hypercapnia is a key correlate of EEG activation and daytime sleepiness in hypercapnic sleep disordered breathing patients. The relationship between hypercapnia and sleepiness may be mediated by reduced neuro-electrical brain activity.\n",

Six hundred and seventy-six (44%) responders reported excessive daytime sleepiness during their professional activity. The independent factors associated with excessive daytime sleepiness were female sex (odds ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.34), tea consumption (odds ratio 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.91), regular practice of nap (odds ratio 1.68, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.09), stress at home (odds ratio 1.31, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.68), more than four extended work shifts monthly (odds ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.56) and sleep disorders (odds ratio 1.73, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.29). Reporting sleep disorder duration and a sleep time less than 7h were the two major risk factors for sleep disorders. Female sex was the major risk factor for excessive daytime sleepiness.

      "Processing abstract: Glucose and fat metabolism in narcolepsy and the effect of sodium oxybate: a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study. Narcolepsy is associated with obesity though it is uncertain whether this is caused by changes in glucose and fat metabolism. Therefore, we performed a detailed analysis of systemic energy homeostasis in narcolepsy patients, and additionally, investigated whether it was affected by three months of sodium oxybate (sodium oxybate) treatment. Glucose disposal rate (GDR) per unit serum insulin was significantly higher in narcolepsy patients compared to matched controls (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.3 mumol/kgFFM/min/mUxL; P = 0.024), whereas beta-cell function was similar (P = 0.50). Basal steady state glycerol appearance rate tended to be lower in narcolepsy patients (5.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.3 mumol/kgFM/min; P = 0.058), suggesting a lower rate of lipolysis. sodium oxybate treatment induced a trend in reduction of the GDR (1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.2 mumol/kgFFM/min/mUxL; P = 0.063) and a reduction in endogenous glucose production (0.24 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.03 mumol/kgFFM/min/mUxL: P = 0.028) per unit serum insulin. After sodium oxybate treatment lipolysis increased (4.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.5 +/- 0.6 mumol/kgFM/min; P = 0.018), and body weight decreased in narcolepsy patients (99.2 +/- 6.0 vs. 94.0 +/- 5.4 kg; P = 0.044). We show that narcolepsy patients are more insulin sensitive and may have a lower rate of lipolysis than matched controls. sodium oxybate stimulated lipolysis in narcolepsy patients, possibly accounting for the weight loss after treatment. While sodium oxybate tended to decrease systemic insulin sensitivity, it increased hepatic insulin sensitivity, suggesting tissue-specific effects.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Challenges in diagnosing narcolepsy without cataplexy: a consensus statement. Diagnosing narcolepsy without cataplexy is often a challenge as the symptoms are nonspecific, current diagnostic tests are limited, and there are no useful biomarkers. In this report, we review the clinical and physiological aspects of narcolepsy without cataplexy, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures, and the differential diagnoses, and we propose an approach for more accurate diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy.  To aid in the identification of narcolepsy without cataplexy, we review key indicators of narcolepsy and present a diagnostic algorithm. A detailed clinical history is mainly helpful to rule out other possible causes of chronic sleepiness. The multiple sleep latency test remains the most important measure, and prior sleep deprivation, shift work, or circadian disorders should be excluded by actigraphy or sleep logs. A short REM sleep latency (<= 15 minutes) on polysomnography can aid in the diagnosis of narcolepsy without cataplexy, although sensitivity is low. Finally, measurement of hypocretin levels can helpful, as levels are low to intermediate in 10% to 30% of narcolepsy without cataplexy patients.\n",

Of 465 subjects completing the advanced-Parkinson's disease double-blind study, 391 entered the advanced-Parkinson's disease open-label extension; 329 completed it. Reported adverse events with incidence >=10.0%were dyskinesia (27.4%) and somnolence (13.6%). Impulse control disorders were identified by semi-structured interview in 13 subjects (1.4% of 902). In exploratory analyses, adjusted mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UParkinson's diseaseRS) PartsII + III scores (excluding ex-placebo recipients) remained substantially improved from double-blind baseline scores prior to pramipexole introduction, at -6.6 and -6.3 points amongst ex-double-blind-extended release and ex-double-blind-immediate release recipients after 113 weeks of pramipexole (33 double-blind plus 80 open-label) in early Parkinson's disease, and -11.5 and -9.1 after up to 113 weeks (up to 33 double-blind plus 80 open-label) in advanced Parkinson's disease. These results support the long-term safety and efficacy of pramipexole extended release in early and advanced Parkinson's disease. adverse events were typical for dopaminergic medications, and UParkinson's diseaseRS scores suggested sustained symptomatic benefit.\n",

The meta-analysis included 24 association studies for the catechol-O-methyltransferase rs4680 SNP (9719 Parkinson's disease patients, 14634 controls) and the risk for Parkinson's disease. The frequency of allele positivity showed a significant association between rs4680 and the risk for Parkinson's disease in the total series, as well as homozygosity for the low-activity allele in the Asiatic population (these associations were marginal or disappeared when studies on Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium were not considered). Global diagnostic odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for rs4680 were 0.99 (0.94-1.04) for the total group, 0.99 (0.93-1.05) for White, and 1.05 (0.90-1.22) for Asiatic individuals. catechol-O-methyltransferase genotypes could be related with a modest modification in the age at onset of Parkinson's disease, but its possible genotypes in excessive daytime somnolence, impulse control disorders, cognitive impairment, and neuropharmacological or neurochemical variables are unclear. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that the catechol-O-methyltransferase rs4680 polymorphism is not a major determinant of either the risk for Parkinson's disease or clinical, neuropharmacological and neurochemical features of Parkinson's disease. Data on other catechol-O-methyltransferase polymorphisms are scarce but do not suggest association with Parkinson's disease.\n",

Inter-laboratory epoch-by-epoch agreement comparison between scorers from the two countries yielded a moderate agreement with a mean kappa value of 0.57 for controls, 0.58 for sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome, and 0.54 for narcolepsy. When compared with controls, the inter-scoring agreement is higher for wake and N3 stage scoring in sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome and N1 and N3 scoring in narcolepsy (p<0.05). The only sleep stage with lower scoring agreement in both sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (kappa 0.69 vs. 0.79, p=0.034) and narcolepsy (0.66 vs 0.79, p=0.022) was stage REM. Inter-laboratory comparisons showed that the most common combinations of deviating scorings were N1 and N2, N2 and N3, and N1 and wake. A 6.5% deviating scoring rate of wake and REM and a 13.4% deviating scoring rate of N1 and REM indicated that inter-laboratory scoring in narcolepsy was about twice as in sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome and controls confused. This was further confirmed by agreement analysis of quantitative parameters using intra-class correlation coefficients ICC(2,1) indicating REM sleep scoring agreement was lower in narcolepsy than in controls (p<0.05). Low REM stage scoring agreement exists for narcoleptics and sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome, indicating the necessity to study sleep stage scoring agreement for a specific sleep disorder. Intensive training is needed for the scoring of sleep in international multiple center studies to improve the scoring agreement.\n",

Nightmares were found in one-third of the patients, proportionally distributed in N and narcolepsy with cataplexy groups; not negatively charged vivid dreams appeared more frequently in narcolepsy with cataplexy patients (P<0.005). No/mundane dreams occurred with higher prevalence in men (48%) than in women (20%), (P<0.005), without any significant influence of age. Occurrence of nightmares was significantly higher in patients with REM sleep behavior (P<0.05), but lower in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (P<0.005).

      "Processing abstract: Increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of nerve cell biomarkers in narcolepsy with cataplexy. The association between narcolepsy with cataplexy and the hypocretinergic system in the central nervous system is strong since up to 75-90% of all patients have cerebrospinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) hypocretin-1 deficiency. The predominant occurrence of HLADQB1*0602 tissue type in narcolepsy patients and recent results from genome-wide association studies suggest an underlying immunological mechanism. The present study was initiated to clarify whether measurement of nerve cell biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid could give additional knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms causing narcolepsy with cataplexy. The concentrations of all biomarkers were significantly elevated in both patient groups compared to the controls. The concentration of beta-amyloid was significantly higher in the patient group with normal cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 concentration than in those with low concentrations, whereas the other biomarkers showed no difference between the patient groups. The findings of elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers independent of cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 reduction may reflect alterations in cell metabolism. The results suggest a more extensive affection of the sleep regulating cellular network, affecting other neuronal sites important in the regulation of sleep, in addition to the hypocretin-producing neurons.\n",

DISP diagnoses had fair to substantial concordance with clinician diagnoses for various sleep disorders, with area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) ranging from 0.65 to 0.84. Participants classified by the clinician as having a sleep disorder were moderately well-detected (sensitivity ranging from 0.50 for RBD disorder to 0.87 for insomnia). Substantial specificity (>0.8) also was seen for five of the eight sleep disorders (i.e., delayed sleep phase, hypersomnia, NC, PLMD, and RBD).

Patients older than 29 years had less sleep onset REM periods than the younger ones (p:0.045). Shortening the multiple latency sleep test to three or four naps decreased the capability of the test to support the diagnosis of narcolepsy in 14.7 and 10% respectively. The temporal distribution of sleep onset REM periods in the multiple latency sleep test is not even in narcolepsy, with the fourth nap having the lowest probability of presenting a SOREMP.

      "Processing abstract: Excessive daytime sleepiness works together with other sleep disorders in determining sleepiness-related events in shift workers. Shift-workers may experience sleep disturbances more frequently than day-workers. Interactions between obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea), shift-work and other factors promoting sleepiness have never been studied. The present study was designed to assess the prevalence of excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness), high risk for obstructive sleep apnea (high risk for OSA) and insomnia in shift-workers and day-workers and to evaluate their mutual effects on the risk of home-to-work commuting car accidents or episodes of falling asleep during work. Forty-nine subjects had high risk for OSA. excessive daytime sleepiness was more frequent in shift-workers than in day-workers (16.3% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.01) and in workers with high risk for OSA (28.6% vs. 8.4%, P < 0.001) or insomnia (35.7% vs. 9.5%, P < 0.001). Path analysis support the evidence that excessive daytime sleepiness was directly linked to shift-work, high risk for OSA and insomnia. Car accidents or falling asleep at work were directly associated with excessive daytime sleepiness and shift-work, and indirectly (via excessive daytime sleepiness) with high risk for OSA and insomnia. Development of excessive daytime sleepiness in shift-workers is not only due to work schedule, but also to the presence of sleep disorders. obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia co-promote falling asleep during work and sleepiness-related car accidents.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prader Willi syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea: co-occurrence in the pediatric population. A high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) occurs in children with Prader-Willi syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome). Yet, due in part to the relatively small samples previously used, the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea has varied greatly across studies. It is also unclear if factors such as age, gender, body mass index (body mass index), or type of genetic imprinting are associated with increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea among children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Fourteen studies of children diagnosed with Prader-Willi syndrome and who were assessed for obstructive sleep apnea using polysomnography (polysomnography) met inclusion criteria (n = 224 children). The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea across studies was 79.91% (n = 179/224). Among youths with obstructive sleep apnea, 53.07% had mild obstructive sleep apnea, 22.35% moderate obstructive sleep apnea, and 24.58% severe obstructive sleep apnea. Narcolepsy was found to occur in 35.71% of children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Adenotonsillectomy was associated with improvement in obstructive sleep apnea for most children with Prader-Willi syndrome. However, residual obstructive sleep apnea was present in the majority of cases post-surgery. This study confirms the high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy among children with Prader-Willi syndrome. Screening for obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy among children with Prader-Willi syndrome is recommended. In addition, while adenotonsillectomy was effective in reducing obstructive sleep apnea for some children, alternative treatments may need to be considered, given the only moderate response rate.\n",

The modified model had a good overall fit (chi2 = 1.3, P = .54; comparative fit index = 1.0; root-mean square error of approximation = 0.0; standardized root-mean square residual = 0.02). Most paths in this model were significant (P < .05). Fatigue predicted anxiety, depression, and daytime sleepiness. Depression predicted daytime sleepiness and poor vigilance, whereas anxiety tended to predict reduced daytime sleepiness. This model confirms the complexity of fatigue experience. It supports the hypothesis that fatigue after traumatic brain injury is a cause, not a consequence, of anxiety, depression, and daytime sleepiness, which, in turn (especially depression), may exacerbate fatigue by affecting cognitive functioning. These findings suggest that to alleviate fatigue, it is important to address each of these factors. However, the findings need to be confirmed with a longitudinal research design.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The adjuvant component alpha-tocopherol triggers via modulation of Nrf2 the expression and turnover of hypocretin in vitro and its implication to the development of narcolepsy. After the H1N1 swine flu vaccination campaign an increased number of narcolepsy cases in children and adolescents was observed in Scandinavian and later in further European countries that correlated with the vaccination by an AS03-adjuvanted influenza vaccine (Pandemrix). Narcolepsy is a chronic sleep disorder characterized by the loss of hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid due to selective destruction of hypocretin-producing neurons in the perifornical hypothalamus. In >99% of the cases narcolepsy is associated with the HLA-subtype DQB1*602 giving the link to an autoimmune process. In contrast to other squalene-based adjuvants, for which no association with narcolepsy was reported so far, ASO3 contains in addition alpha-tocopherol. It could be observed recently that alpha-tocopherol activates the transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2 triggers the expression of cytoprotective genes, i.e. the catalytic active subunits of the constitutive proteasome, by binding to the antioxidant response element (antioxidant response element). It was hypothesized that alpha-tocopherol via activation of Nrf2 affects expression and turnover of hypocretin, leading to an increased amount of hypocretinalpha-specific fragments that bind to DQB1*602. alpha-Tocopherol activates Nrf2 in neuronal cells in vitro. Promoter analysis revealed an antioxidant response element sequence in the hypocretin promoter. Indeed, alpha-tocopherol increases by activation of Nrf2 the expression of hypocretin. In parallel, alpha-tocopherol -dependent induction of Nrf2 augments expression of catalytic subunits of the proteasome leading to increased degradation of hypocretin. Moreover, elevated activation of Nrf2 is associated with a decreased activity of NF-kappaB that results in an increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. In case of a genetic predisposition (DQB1*602) alpha-tocopherol could confer to development of narcolepsy by activation of Nrf2 that finally leads to an elevated formation of longer hypocretin-derived fragments that can be presented by HLA-subtype DQB1*602. These cells are recognized by the immune system and due to their increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli they can be destroyed, finally leading to a lack of hypocretin.\n",

Armodafinil is a medication used to treat excessive sleepiness in individuals with shift work disorder (shift work disorder). In the present study, we investigate whether armodafinil can normalize nocturnal sleepiness in a group of typical shift work disorder patients. Subjects with shift work disorder had a mean MSLT of 5.3 +/- 3.25 minutes, indicating a mean level of pathological sleepiness. Armodafinil significantly improved MSLT score to 11.1 +/- 4.79 minutes (P = 0.006). Subjective levels of alertness on the visual analog scale also improved (P = 0.008). For performance, reaction time to central (P = 0.006) and peripheral (P = 0.003) stimuli and free recall memory (P = 0.05) were also improved. Armodafinil 150 mg administered at the beginning of a night shift normalizes nocturnal sleepiness in individuals with shift work disorder unselected for objective sleepiness. Subjective measures of sleepiness and cognitive performance are also improved. This suggests that armodafinil can improve levels of nocturnal alertness to within normal daytime levels in the majority of patients with shift work disorder.\n",

Sleep recordings found sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods (sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) revealed increased cerebellar myoinositol (myoinositol) in both subjects. Auditory and ophthalmologic investigations as well as structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) scans revealed no abnormalities. The two asymptomatic carriers of the heterozygous DNMT1 mutation for ADCA-DN, a late-onset neurodegenerative disease, presented with sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods associated with an increase of myoinositol in the brain, a marker of glial cell activity and density characteristic of early stages of neurodegenerative diseases.

Here, we investigated relative changes in regional brain metabolism in Kleine-Levin syndrome (Kleine-Levin syndrome) during symptomatic episodes and asymptomatic periods, as compared to healthy controls. Between state-comparisons in Kleine-Levin syndrome disclosed higher metabolism in paracentral, precentral, and postcentral areas, supplementary motor area, medial frontal gyrus, thalamus and putamen during symptomatic episodes, and decreased metabolism in occipital and temporal gyri. As compared to healthy control subjects, Kleine-Levin syndrome patients in the asymptomatic phase consistently exhibited significant hypermetabolism in a wide cortical network including frontal and temporal cortices, posterior cingulate and precuneus, with no detected hypometabolism. In symptomatic Kleine-Levin syndrome episodes, hypermetabolism was additionally found in orbital frontal and supplementary motor areas, insula and inferior parietal areas, and right caudate nucleus, and hypometabolism in the middle occipital gyrus and inferior parietal areas. Our results demonstrated significant hypermetabolism and few hypometabolism in specific but widespread brain regions in drug-free Kleine-Levin syndrome patients at baseline and during symptomatic episodes, highlighting the behavioral state-dependent nature of changes in regional brain activity in Kleine-Levin syndrome.\n",

Midnight melatonin remained independently related to sleep time after adjustment for cortisol. Three different patterns of melatonin profiles were observed; normal (n=6), absent midnight peak (n=6) and phase-shifted peak (n=2). Only patients with absent midnight peak had impaired sleep quality, increased daytime sleepiness and general and mental fatigue.

Younger obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients (P = .001) and those who were male (P = .001), had greater neck circumference (P = .002), had a higher Epworth sleepiness score (ESS; P < .0001), and had a higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; p = .039) had more motor vehicle accidents than obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients. Daytime sleepiness was associated with a 2.74-fold increase (95% CI, 1.54 to 4.87, P = .001) in accident risk. In multiple logistic regression analysis, accident risk was associated with neck circumference (P < .031) and ESS (P < .0001). In addition, accident risk could be excluded in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients with neck circumference < 43 cm and ESS < 11 (sensitivity 33.3%, specificity 85.8%). The present results show that obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients have a twofold higher risk of traffic accidents than control subjects, and increased neck circumference and excessive daytime sleepiness are useful in predicting obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients at higher risk of having accidents.\n",

Sleep disturbances, including reduced nocturnal sleep time, sleep fragmentation, nocturnal wandering and daytime sleepiness are common clinical problems in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (Alzheimer's disease), and are associated with significant caregiver distress, increased healthcare costs and institutionalisation. Drug treatment is often sought to alleviate these problems, but there is significant uncertainty about the efficacy and adverse effects of the various hypnotic drugs in this vulnerable population. We found randomized controlled trials eligible for inclusion for three drugs: melatonin (209 participants, three studies, but only two yielded data suitable for meta-analysis), trazodone (30 participants, one study) and ramelteon (74 participants, one study, no peer-reviewed publication, very limited information available).The melatonin and trazodone studies were of people with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease; the ramelteon study was of people with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. In all studies participants had a variety of common sleep problems. All primary sleep outcomes were measured using actigraphy. In one study of melatonin, drug treatment was combined with morning bright light therapy. Only two studies made a systematic assessment of adverse effects. Overall, the published studies were at low risk of bias, although there were areas of incomplete reporting and some problems with participant attrition, related largely to poor tolerance of actigraphy and technical difficulties. The risk of bias in the ramelteon study was unclear due to incomplete reporting.We found no evidence that melatonin, either immediate- or slow-release, improved any major sleep outcome in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We were able to synthesize data for two sleep outcomes: total nocturnal sleep time (MD 10.68 minutes, 95% CI -16.22 to 37.59, two studies), and the ratio of daytime sleep to night-time sleep (MD -0.13, 95% CI -0.29 to 0.03, two studies). Other outcomes were reported in single studies. We found no difference between intervention and control groups for sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset or number of night-time awakenings, nor in cognition or performance of activities of daily living (Alzheimer's diseaseLs). No serious adverse effects of melatonin were reported in the included studies.Trazodone 50 mg administered at night for two weeks significantly improved total nocturnal sleep time (MD 42.46 minutes, 95% CI 0.9 to 84.0, one study) and sleep efficiency (MD 8.53, 95% CI 1.9 to 15.1, one study), but there was no clear evidence of any effect on the amount of time spent awake after sleep onset (MD -20.41, 95% CI -60.4 to 19.6, one study) or the number of nocturnal awakenings (MD -3.71, 95% CI -8.2 to 0.8, one study). No effect was seen on daytime sleep, nor on cognition or Alzheimer's diseaseLs. No serious adverse effects were reported.Results from a phase 2 trial investigating ramelteon 8 mg administered at night were available in summary form in a sponsor's synopsis. Ramelteon had no effect on total nocturnal sleep time at one week (primary outcome) or eight weeks (end of treatment). The synopsis reported few significant differences from placebo for any sleep, behavioural or cognitive outcomes; none were likely to be of clinical significance. There were no serious adverse effects of ramelteon. We discovered a distinct lack of evidence to help guide drug treatment of sleep problems in Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we found no randomized controlled trials of many drugs that are widely prescribed for sleep problems in Alzheimer's disease, including the benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, although there is considerable uncertainty about the balance of benefits and risks associated with these common treatments. From the studies we identified for this review, we found no evidence that melatonin is beneficial to Alzheimer's disease patients with moderate to severe dementia and sleep problems. There is some evidence to support the use of a low dose (50 mg) of trazodone, although a larger trial is needed to allow a more definitive conclusion to be reached on the balance of risks and benefits. There was no evidence of any effect of ramelteon on sleep in patients with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. This is an area with a high need for pragmatic trials, particularly of those drugs that are in common clinical use for sleep problems in Alzheimer's disease. Systematic assessment of adverse effects is essential.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Criterion validity of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale for the diagnosis of sleep disorders.  The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (and its subscale) were <0.9, meaning that these questionnaires were not highly accurate for predicting the four sleep disorders. The meta-analysis found that the Epworth Sleepiness Scale had no value in identifying obstructive sleep apnea. The variable that most strongly influenced Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index or Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Epworth Sleepiness Scale should no longer be used as a screening or diagnostic instrument for the four polysomnography-defined sleep disorders, especially in a low-risk population.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Accuracy of portable polygraphy for the diagnosis of sleep apnea in multiple system atrophy.  Among 30 patients enrolled, seven were excluded for technical problems on polygraphy or polysomnography and 23 were included in the main analysis. Eight out of 23 had an AHI>=5 on polysomnography. With the same threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of polygraphy for the diagnosis of sleep apnea were 87.5% (95% confidence interval: 47-99), 80% (52-96), 70% (35-93) and 92.3% (64-99), respectively. The kappa between polygraphy raters was 0.75 (0.49-1.00) indicating good agreement. The area under the receiver operating characteristics was 0.93 (0.82-1.00). No association was found between sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness questionnaires and sleep apnea. Portable polygraphy seems to be valuable for ruling out sleep apnea in Msleep apnea.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Cataplectic facies: clinical marker in the diagnosis of childhood narcolepsy-report of two cases. Narcolepsy is a chronic disease and is commonly diagnosed in adulthood. However, more than half of the patients have onset of symptoms in childhood and/or adolescence. The full spectrum of clinical manifestations, namely excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis, is usually not present at disease onset, delaying diagnosis during childhood. Mean delay in diagnosis since symptom onset is known to be several years. Initial manifestations can sometimes be as subtle as only partial drooping of eyelids leading to confusion with a myasthenic condition. The diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by multiple sleep latency test along with human leukocyte antigen typing and cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin assay. The diagnosis of narcolepsy with cataplexy at onset can be challenging in young children. With more awareness of subtle signs such as cataplectic facies, earlier diagnosis is possible. To date, only 11 children between 6 and 18 years of age presenting with typical cataplectic facies have been reported in the literature. We present two patients, one of whom is the youngest individual (4 years old) yet described with the typical cataplectic facies.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Symptoms of sleep disordered breathing in children with craniofacial malformations. Moraleda-Cibrian M; Edwards SP; Kasten SJ; Berger M; Buchman SR; O'Brien LM. Symptoms of sleep disordered breathing in children with craniofacial malformations. Overall, 25% of children screened positive for sleep disordered breathing, 28% for snoring, and 20% for sleepiness. In children with non-syndromic craniofacial malformations, those with Robin sequence had the highest frequency of sleep disordered breathing, snoring, and sleepiness (43%, 44%, and 38%, respectively). In children with syndromic craniofacial malformations, velocardiofacial/ DiGeorge syndrome had the highest frequency of sleep disordered breathing and sleepiness (48% and 43%, respectively). Children with Treacher Collins had the highest frequency of snoring (83%). The presence of cleft palate was not associated with an increased frequency of sleep disordered breathing symptoms. Nevertheless, children with syndromic craniofacial malformations, compared to those with non-syndromic craniofacial malformations, had a higher sleep disordered breathing score (0.27 +/- 0.21 vs.0.21 +/- 0.19, p = 0.003) and were more likely to have sleepiness (26% vs. 18%, p = 0.05). Congenital craniofacial malformations in children are associated with high risk for sleep disordered breathing symptoms. Our findings should encourage a high index of suspicion for sleep disordered breathing in children with craniofacial malformations, with a low threshold for further testing and close follow-up.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Relationship of heart rate variability to sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea with and without heart failure. Many patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) do not complain of excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness), possibly due to increased sympathetic nervous activity (sympathetic nervous activity) and accompanying heightened alertness. We hypothesized that in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, those without subjective excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, ESS score < 11) would have higher very low frequency (very low frequency) heart rate variability (heart rate variability) during sleep, reflecting greater sympathetic heart rate modulation than patients with an ESS score >= 11.\n",
      "Taranto Montemurro L; Floras JS; Picton P; Kasai T; Alshaer H; Gabriel JM; Bradley TD. Relationship of heart rate variability to sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea with and without heart failure. Subjects without excessive daytime sleepiness had higher harmonic very low frequency power (944 +/- 839 vs 447 +/- 461 msec(2), p = 0.003) than those with excessive daytime sleepiness, irrespective of the presence or absence of heart failure (1218 +/- 944 vs 426 +/- 299 msec(2), p = 0.043, and 1029 +/- 873 vs 503 +/- 533 msec(2), p = 0.003, respectively). ESS scores correlated inversely with very low frequency power in all (r = -0.294, p = 0.005) and in heart failure subjects (r = -0.468, p = 0.016). Patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea but without excessive daytime sleepiness have higher very low frequency-heart rate variability than those with excessive daytime sleepiness. This finding suggests that patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea but without excessive daytime sleepiness have greater sympathetic modulation of heart rate variability than those with excessive daytime sleepiness that may reflect elevated adrenergically mediated alertness.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Fatigued on Venus, sleepy on Mars-gender and racial differences in symptoms of sleep apnea.  Of 384 consecutive subjects, including 218 women (57%), there were 230 Whites (60%) and 154 Blacks (40%), with average age of 55.9+/-12.8years. Berlin Questionnaires identified 221 subjects (58%) as having high likelihood for obstructive sleep apnea. Fatigue was much more common in women (75%) than in men (46%) with obstructive sleep apnea (p<0.001), while frequency of fatigue was similar in women (30%) and men (29%) without obstructive sleep apnea (p=0.86). In multivariate analysis, men with obstructive sleep apnea were sleepier than women; Black men with obstructive sleep apnea had higher Epworth scores (mean+/-SD, 12.8+/-5.2) compared to White men (10.6+/-5.3), White women (10.0+/-4.5), and Black women (10.5+/-5.2), p=0.05. These gender differences were not related to the effects of age, body mass index, perceived stress, sleep duration, or thyroid function. Women report fatigue more commonly with obstructive sleep apnea than men. Men experience sleepiness more commonly with obstructive sleep apnea than women. The findings suggest that evaluation of sleep disorders must include an assessment of fatigue in addition to sleepiness to capture the experience of women.\n",

      "Processing abstract: Cardiovascular and psychiatric morbidity in obstructive sleep apnea (obstructive sleep apnea) with insomnia (sleep apnea plus) versus obstructive sleep apnea without insomnia: a case-control study from a Nationally Representative US sample.  Among patient visits with obstructive sleep apnea, an estimated 6.4%+/- 0.9% also had insomnia. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the obstructive sleep apnea+Insomnia group was significantly more likely to have essential hypertension (all ICD9-CM codes 401) (OR=1.83, 95% CI 1.27-2.65) and provisionally more likely to have cerebrovascular disease (ICD9-CM codes 430-438) (OR=6.58, 95% CI 1.66-26.08). The significant OR for cerebrovascular disease was considered provisional because the unweighted count was <30. In a nationally representative sample, obstructive sleep apnea+Insomnia was associated significantly more frequently with essential hypertension than obstructive sleep apnea-Insomnia, a finding that has not been previously reported. In contrast to studies that have considered patient self-reports of psychological morbidity, the absence of a significant association with psychiatric disorders in our study may be indicative of the fact that we considered only physician-rated psychiatric syndromes meeting ICD9-CM criteria. Our findings among the obstructive sleep apnea+Insomnia group are therefore most likely conservative.\n",

The sisters had a complex movement disorders with dystonia and diurnal fluctuations. Both had oculogyric crises, and the older sister also hypersomnia. Both sisters had raised prolactin levels twice above the reference level. One sister had a dramatic response to levodopa, the other responded, but developed dyskinesia despite low doses. Both patients improved dramatically over time with levodopa (2.3 and 1.5 mg/kg/day). Very low levels of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and increased levels of sepiapterin and dihydrobiopterin were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid before treatment. DNA analyses revealed a novel homozygous mutation in exon 2 in the sepiapterin reductase gene gene, c.364A>G/p.(Tyr123Cys), located in a highly conserved region in the gene. Both parents and the healthy sister were carriers for the same mutation. A new homozygous mutation in the sepiapterin reductase gene gene was found in two sisters with dopa-responsive dystonia. This important and treatable neurotransmitter disorder must be considered in patients with a complex movement disorder with diurnal fluctuations with or without intellectual impairment. Patients with these symptoms should undergo levodopa trial, cerebrospinal fluid investigations, and genetic analyses.\n",

Annual all-cause mortality rates for 2008, 2009, and 2010 were calculated retrospectively for patients with narcolepsy and patients without narcolepsy in the database, and standardized mortality ratios (standardized mortality ratios) were calculated. Mortality rates were also compared with the general US population (Centers for Disease Control data). standardized mortality ratioss of the narcolepsy population were consistent over the 3-year period and showed an approximate 1.5-fold excess mortality relative to those without narcolepsy. The narcolepsy population had consistently higher mortality rates relative to those without narcolepsy across all age groups, stratified by age decile, from 25-34 years to 75+ years of age. The standardized mortality ratios for females with narcolepsy was lower than for males with narcolepsy. Narcolepsy was associated with approximately 1.5-fold excess mortality relative to those without narcolepsy. While the cause of this increased mortality is unknown, these findings warrant further investigation.\n",

The HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele across all ethnic groups and the rs5770917 variation between CPT1B and CHKB genes in Japanese and Koreans are common genetic susceptibility factors for narcolepsy. This comprehensive genetic study sought to assess variations in CHKB and CPT1B susceptibility genes and HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele status in Turkish patients with narcolepsy and healthy persons. The HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele was significantly more frequent in narcoleptic patients than in healthy persons (p=2x10(-7)) and in patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy than in those without (p=0.018). The mean of the multiple sleep latency test, sleep-onset rapid eye movement periods, and frequency of sleep paralysis significantly differed in the HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive patients. rs5770917, rs5770911, rs2269381, and rs2269382 were detected together as a haplotype in three patients and 11 healthy persons. In addition to this haplotype, the indel variation (rs144647670) was detected in the 5' upstream region of the human CHKB gene in the patients and healthy persons carrying four variants together. This study identified a novel haplotype consisting of the indel variation, which had not been detected in previous studies in Japanese and Korean populations, and observed four single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CHKB/CPT1B. The study confirmed the association of the HLA-DQB1*06:02 allele with narcolepsy and cataplexy susceptibility. The findings suggest that the presence of HLA-DQB1*06:02 may be a predictor of cataplexy in narcoleptic patients and could therefore be used as an additional diagnostic marker alongside hypocretin.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Circadian melatonin rhythm and excessive daytime sleepiness in Parkinson disease.  Patients with Parkinson disease had blunted circadian rhythms of melatonin secretion compared with controls; the amplitude of the melatonin rhythm and the 24-hour area under the curve for circulating melatonin levels were significantly lower in Parkinson disease patients (P<.001). Markers of the circadian phase were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Compared with Parkinson disease patients without excessive daytime sleepiness, patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >=10) had a significantly lower amplitude of the melatonin rhythm and 24-hour melatonin area under the curve (P=.001). Disease duration, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores, levodopa equivalent dose, and global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score in the Parkinson disease group were not significantly related to measures of the melatonin circadian rhythm. Circadian dysfunction may underlie excessive sleepiness in Parkinson disease. The nature of this association needs to be explored further in longitudinal studies. Approaches aimed to strengthen circadian function, such as timed exposure to bright light and exercise, might serve as complementary therapies for the nonmotor manifestations of Parkinson disease.\n",

Titration studies frequently led to recommendations for a change in respiratory support settings in these patients on long-term respiratory support. Symptom scores were more likely to improve if recommendations for change were implemented by the time of the follow-up study.\n",

Compared to wake, control participants displayed a progressive significant decrease of blood pressure and sympathetic activities during nonrapid eye movement (Nrapid eye movement) sleep and an increase of autonomic activity during rapid eye movement sleep, as expected. narcolepsy with cataplexy patients showed: (1) a decrease of sympathetic activities during SOrapid eye movementP comparable to Nrapid eye movement sleep stage 1 (NREM sleep stage 1) but in contrast to the increased activity typical of rapid eye movement sleep; and (2) physiologic sympathetic change during the following sleep stages with a progressive decrease during Nrapid eye movement sleep stage 2 (NREM sleep stage 2) and Nrapid eye movement sleep stage 3 (NREM sleep stage 3) and a clear increase in rapid eye movement sleep, though blood pressure did not show the physiologic decrease during sleep (nondipper pattern). SOrapid eye movementPs in narcolepsy with cataplexy patients lack the sympathetic activation occurring during physiologic rapid eye movement sleep, thus suggesting a dissociated rapid eye movement sleep condition. In addition, our data indicated that hypocretin plays a limited role in the regulation of sympathetic changes during sleep.\n",

Bivariate associations indicated that depressive feelings were associated with fatigue (48%), hyperactivity (31%), insomnia (16%), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) (14-24%). In the multivariate model adjusted for gender and age, only fatigue explained the variability of the depression score. In our large cohort, high levels of depressive symptoms essentially expressed by fatigue affected 25% of children with narcolepsy. The girls older than 10 years of age were especially vulnerable.

      "Processing abstract: Ecological momentary assessment of fatigue, sleepiness, and exhaustion in ESKD. Many patients on maintenance dialysis experience significant sleepiness and fatigue. However, the influence of the hemodialysis (HD) day and circadian rhythms on patients' symptoms have not been well characterized. We sought to use ecological momentary assessment to evaluate day-to-day and diurnal variability of fatigue, sleepiness, exhaustion and related symptoms in thrice-weekly maintenance HD patients. The 55 participants completed 1,252 of 1,540 (81%) possible assessments over the 7 day period. Multiple symptoms related to mood (e.g., feeling sad, feeling tense), cognition (e.g., difficulty concentrating), and fatigue (e.g., exhaustion, feeling sleepy) demonstrated significant daily and diurnal variation, with higher overall symptom scores noted on hemodialysis days and later in the day. In factor analysis, 4 factors explained the majority of the observed variance for DISS symptoms. Fatigue, sleepiness, and exhaustion loaded onto the same factor and were highly intercorrelated. In LMM, mean composite fatigue-sleepiness-exhaustion scores were associated with dialysis day (coefficient and 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 [0.02 - 0.39]) and time of day (coefficient and 95% CI 0.33 [0.25 - 0.41]. Observed associations were minimally affected by adjustment for demographics and common confounders.

As opposed to fleeting hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations of the sleep/wake transition, dream delusions were false memories induced by the experience of a vivid dream, which led to false beliefs that could persist for days or weeks. The delusional confusion of dreamed events with reality is a prominent feature of narcolepsy, and suggests the possibility of source memory deficits in this disorder that have not yet been fully characterized.\n",

A version of this task (reading span) was presented to the participants during functional magnetic resonance imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Activation in the thalamus was measured in a region of interest analysis. A combination of the working memory capacity and the thalamic activation measures resulted in 80% prediction accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 78% specificity regarding the ability to separate Kleine-Levin Syndrome patients from healthy controls. The controls had an inverse relation between working memory capacity and thalamic activation; higher performing participants had lower thalamic activation (r = -0.41). Kleine-Levin Syndrome patients showed the opposite relationship; higher performing participants had a tendency to higher thalamic activation (r = -0.35). This study shows that functional neuroimaging of the thalamus combined with neuropsychological assessment of working memory function provides a means to guide diagnosis of Kleine-Levin Syndrome. Results in this study also indicate that imaging of brain function and evaluation of cognitive capacity can give insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of Kleine-Levin Syndrome.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Does excessive daytime sleepiness affect children's pedestrian safety?  Children with excessive daytime sleepiness were riskier pedestrians than healthy children. They were twice as likely to be struck by a virtual vehicle in the virtual pedestrian environment than healthy controls. Attentional skills of looking at oncoming traffic were not impaired among children with excessive daytime sleepiness, but decision-making for when to cross the street safely was significantly impaired. Results suggest excessive daytime sleepiness (excessive daytime sleepiness) from the clinical sleep disorders known as the hypersomnias of central origin may have significant consequences on children's daytime functioning in a critical domain of personal safety, pedestrian skills. Cognitive processes involved in safe pedestrian crossings may be impaired in children with excessive daytime sleepiness. In the pedestrian simulation, children with excessive daytime sleepiness appeared to show a pattern consistent with inattentional blindness, in that they \"looked but did not process\" information in their pedestrian environment. Results highlight the need for heightened awareness of potentially irreversible consequences of untreated sleep disorders and identify a possible target for pediatric injury prevention.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Beyond a motor disorder: a prospective evaluation of sleep quality in cervical dystonia. Little is known about sleep disturbances in cervical dystonia (cervical dystonia), particularly the relationship to motoric symptoms. It is critical to clarify these points given the impact on quality of life. 54 cervical dystonia patients and 55 controls were included. Impaired sleep quality was more frequent in cervical dystonia compared to controls (t=4.82, p<0.0005), even when controlling for the effects of depression, anxiety, and benzodiazepineuse (F=5.62, p=0.020). Excessive daytime sleepiness was not significantly different between groups (t=1.67, p=0.1). 48 patients received BoNT and returned for follow-up. There was no improvement in sleep quality (t=0.834, p=0.41) or daytime somnolence (t=1.77, p=0.083) despite improvement in cervical dystonia severity (t=4.77, p<0.0005) with BoNT. There was a small improvement in health impact (t=2.10, p=0.04). Sleep quality was more impaired in cervical dystonia patients, compared to healthy subjects, and did not improve following BoNT treatment, despite a robust improvement in cervical dystonia severity. This dichotomy suggests that sleep aberrations in cervical dystonia require separate focus for effective treatment and cannot be viewed as secondary complications of the motor elements of this condition.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Measuring subjective sleepiness at work in hospital nurses: validation of a modified delivery format of the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Sleepiness during the work shift is common and can be hazardous to workers and, in the case of nurses, to patients under their care. Thus, measuring sleepiness in occupational studies is an important component of workplace health and safety. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale) is usually used as a momentary assessment of a respondent's state of sleepiness; however, end-of-shift measurement is sometimes preferred based on the study setting. We assessed the predictive validity of the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale as an end-of-shift recall measurement, asking for \"average\" sleepiness over the shift and \"highest\" level of sleepiness during the shift. Greater sleepiness, as measured by higher Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores, was found on shifts with nurses working night shift, the third sequential night compared to the first, those with sleep disorder symptoms (especially insomnia), and in nurses with trait sleepiness on the Epworth scale. Less sleepiness (lower Karolinska Sleepiness Scale scores) was seen in shifts with a high level of time pressure and in nurses with a biologic predisposition to be more alert in the morning (morningness trait) who worked the day shift. We found partial support for using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale in the recalled format based on our multiple tests of predictive validity.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy: comparison between post-H1N1 vaccination and sporadic cases.  Postvaccine subjects were older at narcolepsy with cataplexy onset (12+/-3 vs. 9+/-3 years; P=.008) and displayed a shorter mean sleep latency in multiple sleep latency tests (multiple sleep latency tests) (2.3+/-2.2 vs. 3.7+/-2.9 min; P=.026) compared to pre-H1N1 cases. Anthropometric, clinical (core narcolepsy with cataplexy symptoms), hypocretin 1 deficiency, and polysomnographic data did not differ among groups, but higher disrupted nocturnal sleep was observed in postvaccine subjects. Comparison of cataplexy features at video assessment showed an overlapping picture with the exception for hyperkinetic movements which appeared to be more evident in pre-H1N1 subjects. The clinical picture of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy was similar in postvaccine and pre-H1N1 children.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Mandibular advancement device and continuous positive airway pressure upon cardiovascular parameters in obstructive sleep apnea.  Both active treatments resulted in decreases in apnea and hypopnea index and Epworth sleepiness scale; continuous positive airway pressure showed a greater effect. Frequency of diastolic blood pressure dipping was higher in the mandibular advancement device group compared with the continuous positive airway pressure group. A significant drop from baseline levels for catalase activity was observed after mandibular advancement device. For heart rate variability, there was a significant decrease in total power at night with continuous positive airway pressure and mandibular advancement device compared with POA, and a decrease in index of sleep autonomic variation with mandibular advancement device compared with baseline levels. Compliance rates were higher with mandibular advancement device rather than continuous positive airway pressure. Even though continuous positive airway pressure proved to be more effective at attenuating obstructive sleep apnea, better compliance with mandibular advancement device favored the reduction of one of the enzymes which participates in oxidative stress and better autonomic modulation during sleep.\n",

      "Processing abstract: The impact of shift duration on the efficacy and tolerability of armodafinil in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with shift work disorder.  Proportion of patients with at least minimal improvement in late-in-shift sleepiness, late-in-shift Clinical Global Impressions-Change (Clinical Global Impressions-Change) rating and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale), as well as overall Global Assessment of Functioning (Global Assessment of Functioning) scale and modified Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS-M), were assessed at baseline and final visit.\n",
      "Of the 383 patients enrolled, 279 (73%) worked shifts <=9 hours and 104 (27%) worked shifts >9 hours. A greater percentage of patients receiving armodafinil had at least minimal improvement in late-in-shift Clinical Global Impressions-Change (<=9 hours: 78% vs 60%, P=0.0017; >9 hours: 77% vs 46%, P=0.0020) regardless of shift duration. Armodafinil patients also demonstrated significantly greater improvements in Global Assessment of Functioning score (<=9 hours: 9.5 vs 5.4, P<0.0001; >9 hours: 9.6 vs 4.3, P=0.0019) and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale score (<=9 hours: -2.9 vs -1.9, P=0.0002; >9 hours: -2.8 vs -1.6, P=0.00 28). Improvement in SDS-M composite score was significantly greater for armodafinil patients working >9 hours (-6.8 vs -2.7, P=0.0086). Headache was the most frequent adverse event in all treatment groups. Patients receiving armodafinil had significantly greater improvements in late-in-shift clinical condition and in wakefulness and overall global functioning than did placebo-treated patients, regardless of shift duration. Prospectively designed, randomized clinical trials that include objective measures of sleepiness are needed to support these findings.\n",
      "Processing abstract: The impact of sleep deprivation on sleepiness, risk factors and professional performance in medical residents. Prolonged working hours and sleep deprivation can exert negative effects on professional performance and health. Medical students and medical residents were comparable demographically except for age, weekly working hours, reported weight gain, and physical activity. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaires indicated a significantly higher and abnormal mean score and higher risk of falling asleep during five of eight daily activities among medical residents as compared with medical students. Medical residents had lower high density lipoprotein levels, a trend towards higher triglyceride levels and higher monocyte count than did medical students. C-reactive protein levels and other laboratory tests were normal and similar in both groups. Among the residents, 5 (15%) were involved in a car accident during residency, and 63% and 49% reported low professional performance and judgment levels after the night shift, respectively. Medical residency service was associated with increased sleepiness, deleterious lifestyle changes, poorer lipid profile, mild complete blood count changes, and reduced professional performance and judgment after working the night shift. However, no significant changes were observed in C-reactive protein or in blood chemistry panel. Larger prospective cohort studies are warranted to evaluate the dynamics in sleepiness and metabolic factors overtime.\n",

      "Processing abstract: The impact of gender on timeliness of narcolepsy diagnosis.  Men and women presented with remarkably similar narcolepsy related symptoms, yet women were more likely to be delayed in diagnosis; 85% of men were likely to be diagnosed by 16 years after symptom onset, compared to 28 years in women. More women were likely to remain undiagnosed at any given time point after symptom onset (hazard ratio for diagnosis of men compared to women 1.53; 95% CI 1.01-2.32; p = 0.04). Men and women reported similar degree of subjective sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (mean 16.2 +/- 4.5; p = 0.18), though women demonstrated significantly more severe objective sleepiness on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) (mean sleep latency in women = 5.4 min (+/- 4.1), in men 7.4 min (+/- 3.5); p = 0.03). Despite being more objectively sleepy, women were less likely to report lifestyle impairments in the areas of personal relationships (71% men, 44% women, p = 0.01) and physical activity (36% men, 16% women, p = 0.02), but were also more likely to self-medicate with caffeine (63.4% men, 82.4% women; p = 0.03). Narcolepsy impacts men and women's health and lifestyle differently, and may cause delays diagnosis for women.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Prevalence of residual excessive sleepiness during effective oral appliance therapy for sleep-disordered breathing. Oral appliance therapy with a mandibular advancement device (OAm) can yield to complete therapeutic response (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5 events/h), though some patients show little or no improvement in daytime sleepiness. The prevalence of residual excessive sleepiness (residual excessive sleepiness) despite effective treatment with OAm therapy is unknown. We aimed to determine the prevalence of residual excessive sleepiness in patients treated with a titratable custom-made duobloc OAm. Out of 185 patients, 84 patients (45%) showed a complete therapeutic response with an AHI of <5 events per hour after 3 months of OAm therapy. Despite this normalization of AHI, 27 out of these 84 patients (32%) showed residual excessive sleepiness and had a significantly higher baseline ESS (15+/-4 vs. 9+/-4; P<.001) and were younger (43+/-9 vs. 47+/-9; P=.028) compared to patients without residual excessive sleepiness. residual excessive sleepiness under OAm therapy showed a prevalence of up to 32% in SDB patients effectively treated with respect to AHI. Patients with residual excessive sleepiness were younger and had higher baseline daytime sleepiness.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Snoring during pregnancy and its relation to sleepiness and pregnancy outcome - a prospective study. The incidence of snoring and sleepiness is known to increase during pregnancy, and this might impact maternal health and obstetric outcome. However, the association between snoring and sleepiness during pregnancy is not fully understood. This study was aimed at investigating the development of snoring during pregnancy and prospectively assessing if there is an association between snoring and sleepiness or adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, mode of delivery, and fetal complications. The frequency of snoring was 7.9% in the 1st trimester and increased to 21.2% in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The women who snored already in early pregnancy had significantly higher baseline BMI (p = 0.001) than the women who never snored, but snoring was not associated with the magnitude of weight gain during pregnancy. Snoring women were more likely to experience edema in late pregnancy than the non-snorers. Women who started to snore during pregnancy had higher Epworth Sleepiness Scores than the non snorers in both early and late pregnancy. No significant association between obstetric outcome and snoring was found. Snoring does increase during pregnancy, and this increase is associated with sleepiness, higher BMI at the start of pregnancy and higher prevalence of edema, but not with weight gain.\n",
      "Processing abstract: Correlation of daytime sleepiness with urine metabolites in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.  The dopamine metabolites, homovanillic acid (r=0.366, P=0.017) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; r=0.584, P<0.0001), were significantly correlated with Epworth sleepiness scale after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, apnea-hypopnea index, sleep efficiency and total sleep time. A two-by-two table analysis revealed that the overnight increase in the urine dihydroxyphenylacetic acid was more frequent in sleepy patients while its decrease was more frequent in non-sleepy patients (odds ratio=3.54, P=0.032). Urine dopamine metabolites may identify sleepy patients with obstructive sleep apnea. In particular, the overnight change of urine dihydroxyphenylacetic acid may indicate obstructive sleep apnea patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.\n"
