Our findings indicate that fatigue severity is more likely to be associated with younger age, sleepiness and insomnia, but less likely to be directly related to OSA severity.

Five experts created an item data-bank pertaining to sleep-related psychological symptoms and somatic perceptions. Fifty patients in two focus groups examined each item for: a) word clarity (indicating any ambiguity of interpretation) and b) appropriateness for the target population. This process permitted to identify 36 appropriate items. Classical Test Theory and Rasch Analysis were used to further refine the questionnaire, yielding the final 17-item set. Concurrent validation of the new scale was tested with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and the Anxiety and Depression questionnaires. MaSQuDI -17 shows good psychometric qualities, and can be used to assess the impact of sleep disorders such as Insomnia, OSAS, Central Hypersomnia and BSD on emotional stress. Starting from the initial item data-bank, a 17-item questionnaire, the Maugeri Sleep Quality and Distress Inventory (MaSQuDI-17), was produced. Parallel Analysis on the MaSQuDI-17 confirmed the presence of a single dimension; exploratory factor analysis showed salient loading for each item, explaining 58.7% of total variance. Item-remainder correlation ranged from 0.72 to 0.39 and Cronbach alpha was 0.896. Rasch analysis revealed satisfactory psychometric properties of the new scale: the rating structure performed according to expectations, model fit was good and no item dependencies emerged.

We contacted authors to obtain missing information. We conducted meta-analyses when pooling of studies was possible. Given the methodological diversity of the included studies, in terms of interventions, settings, and assessment tools, their limited reporting and the very low to low quality of the evidence they present, it is not possible to determine whether shift workers' sleepiness can be reduced or if their sleep length or quality can be improved with these interventions.We need better and adequately powered RCTs of the effect of bright light, and naps, either on their own or together and other non-pharmacological interventions that also consider shift workers' chronobiology on the investigated sleep parameters. We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence. Overall, the included studies' results were inconclusive. We present the results regarding sleepiness below. Bright light Combining two comparable studies (with 184 participants altogether) that investigated the effect of bright light during the night on sleepiness during a shift, revealed a mean reduction 0.83 score points of sleepiness (measured via the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to -0.36, very low quality evidence). Another trial did not find a significant difference in overall sleepiness on another sleepiness scale (16 participants, low quality evidence).Bright light during the night plus sunglasses at dawn did not significantly influence sleepiness compared to normal light (1 study, 17 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence).Bright light during the day shift did not significantly reduce sleepiness during the day compared to normal light (1 trial, 61 participants, subjective assessment, low quality evidence) or compared to normal light plus placebo capsule (1 trial, 12 participants, assessment via reaction time, very low quality evidence). Napping during the night shiftA meta-analysis on a single nap opportunity and the effect on the mean reaction time as a surrogate for sleepiness, resulted in a 11.87 ms reduction (95% CI 31.94 to -8.2, very low quality evidence). Two other studies also reported statistically non-significant decreases in reaction time (1 study seven participants; 1 study 49 participants, very low quality evidence).A two-nap opportunity resulted in a statistically non-significant increase of sleepiness (subjective assessment) in one study (mean difference (MD) 2.32, 95% CI -24.74 to 29.38, 1 study, 15 participants, low quality evidence). Other interventionsPhysical exercise and sleep education interventions showed promise, but sufficient data to draw conclusions are lacking. Person-directed, non-pharmacological interventions for sleepiness at work and sleep disturbances caused by shift work.: Unbalanced parentheses: At least two authors screened titles and abstracts for relevant studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors to obtain missing information. We conducted meta-analyses when pooling of studies was possible. Given the methodological diversity of the included studies, in terms of interventions, settings, and assessment tools, their limited reporting and the very low to low quality of the evidence they present, it is not possible to determine whether shift workers' sleepiness can be reduced or if their sleep length or quality can be improved with these interventions.We need better and adequately powered RCTs of the effect of bright light, and naps, either on their own or together and other non-pharmacological interventions that also consider shift workers' chronobiology on the investigated sleep parameters. We included 17 relevant trials (with 556 review-relevant participants) which we categorised into three types of interventions: (1) various exposures to bright light (n = 10); (2) various opportunities for napping (n = 4); and (3) other interventions, such as physical exercise or sleep education (n = 3). In most instances, the studies were too heterogeneous to pool. Most of the comparisons yielded low to very low quality evidence. Only one comparison provided moderate quality evidence.

However, the influence of the hemodialysis (HD) day and circadian rhythms on patients' symptoms have not been well characterized. We sought to use ecological momentary assessment to evaluate day-to-day and diurnal variability of fatigue, sleepiness, exhaustion and related symptoms in thrice-weekly maintenance HD patients.  Subjects used a modified cellular phone to access an interactive voice response system that administered the Daytime Insomnia Symptom Scale (DISS). The DISS assessed subjective vitality, mood, and alertness through 19 questions using 7- point Likert scales. Subjects completed the DISS 4 times daily for 7 consecutive days. Factor analysis was conducted and a mean composite score of fatigue-sleepiness-exhaustion was created. Linear mixed regression models (LMM) were used to examine the association of time of day, dialysis day and fatigue, sleepiness, and exhaustion composite scores. Maintenance HD patients experience fatigue-sleepiness-exhaustion symptoms that demonstrate significant daily and diurnal variation. The variability in symptoms may contribute to poor symptom awareness by providers and greater misclassification bias of fatigue related symptoms in clinical studies. The 55 participants completed 1,252 of 1,540 (81%) possible assessments over the 7 day period. Multiple symptoms related to mood (e.g., feeling sad, feeling tense), cognition (e.g., difficulty concentrating), and fatigue (e.g., exhaustion, feeling sleepy) demonstrated significant daily and diurnal variation, with higher overall symptom scores noted on hemodialysis days and later in the day. In factor analysis, 4 factors explained the majority of the observed variance for DISS symptoms. Fatigue, sleepiness, and exhaustion loaded onto the same factor and were highly intercorrelated. In LMM, mean composite fatigue-sleepiness-exhaustion scores were associated with dialysis day (coefficient and 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 [0.02 - 0.39]) and time of day (coefficient and 95% CI 0.33 [0.25 - 0.41].

Twenty-two patients with newly diagnosed OSAS and 20 healthy controls were included in the present study. Polysomnography was performed for each participant to determine the presence of OSAS. EDS was defined based on the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score, and patients were grouped as sleepy or non-sleepy according to this score. The hippocampal volume was calculated by MR volumetry using a manual tracing technique. Our findings suggest that EDS is associated with reduced hippocampal volume in OSAS. There was no significant difference between groups in demographic variables. The hippocampus was markedly smaller in the OSAS groups than in controls (p < 0.001 Hippocampal volume was negatively correlated with the ESS score (r = -0.631, p = 0.002). Correlation between hippocampal volume and excessive daytime sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.: Unbalanced parentheses: The limbic system, specifically the hippocampus, plays a key role in controlling the sleep-wake cycle.

The cohort consisted of forty-five patients (6 women, 39 men) diagnosed with OSA. All patients underwent polysomnography, Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and rated subjectively their daytime tendency to sleep with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. The study showed the sleep latency prolongation at 15:00 and 17:00 hours respectively and confirmed connection of excessive daytime sleepiness to fragmentation of nocturnal sleep and OSA severity. Sleep latency was significantly longer at 15:00 and at 17:00 hours compared to previous tests. A significant negative correlation was found between the mean of the MSLT sleep latency and a number of awakenings, the apnoea/hypopnoea index and oxygen desaturation index values.

To date, this issue has not been examined in studies involving a large number of subjects. This study aimed to identify factors associated with poor sleep quality and excessive day-time sleepiness (EDS) in dialysis patients. This cross-sectional observational study involved 400 patients (59% male) from three hemodialysis centers (SD-HEMOFOR). Quality of sleep was evaluated by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), EDS by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by the Berlin questionnaire and comorbidity severity by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Poor sleep quality and EDS were prevalent on chronic hemodialysis. Heart failure, low TSAT and depressive symptoms were independently associated with poor sleep quality. Stroke, anemia and high risk of OSA were independently associated with EDS. These results provide new insight into possible treatment strategies. Poor sleep quality (PSQI >5) was found in 227 individuals (57%) and was associated with older age (p = 0.001), diabetes (p = 0.03), heart failure (p < 0.005), hypoalbuminemia (p = 0.01), low transferrin saturation (TSAT) (p = 0.009), higher CCI score (p = 0.01) and depression (p < 0.005). Independent factors were older age, heart failure, low TSAT and depressive symptoms. Day-time somnolence was present in 108 patients (27%) and was independently associated with stroke [odds ratio (OR) = 2.84, CI 1.03-7.76), lower hemoglobin concentration (OR = 2.45, CI 0.95-3.03) and high risk of OSA (OR = 1.65, CI 1.03-2.63). High risk of OSA (n = 120; 30%), was associated with hypertension (p < 0.001), overweight/obesity (p = 0.001), older age (p = 0.003) and symptoms of depression (p = 0.01).

      "DEBUG:abbreviations.schwartz_hearst:0 Error processing sentence Armodafinil (the R-isomer of racemic modafinil) and modafinil are wakefulness-promoting medications for excessive sleepiness associated with treated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The R-isomer of racemic modafinil has a half-life of approximately15 hours; the S-isomer has a half-life of 4 to 5 hours. The R-and S-isomers are equipotent, producing equivalent pharmacologic activity at equal concentrations. The aim of this work was to compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of armodafinil (R-modafinil) and modafinil (racemic mixture with equal quantities of R- and S-isomers) at equal doses in patients with residual excessive sleepiness associated with continuous positive airway pressure-treated OSA. This open-label study was conducted at 5 US centers from July 2008 to March 2009. Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 crossover administration sequences, ABCD or BADC, where A was a single armodafinil 200-mg dose, B was a single modafinil 200-mg dose, C was multiple daily modafinil 200-mg doses, and D was multiple daily armodafinil 200-mg doses. During multiple-dose administration, patients received 100 mg once daily for days 1 and 2, and 200 mg once daily for days 3 through 10. The pharmacokinetic parameters of principal interest for assessing the bioequivalence of armodafinil and modafinil were maximum concentration at 7 to 11 hours after dosing and the concentration-versus-time curve for this period. Analysis was performed via achiral high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection using blood samples obtained over 72 hours after single-dose administration and over 24 hours after the multiple-dose regimen. For post hoc evaluation of bioequivalence, 90% CI values were also constructed for the geometric mean ratios of armodafinil to modafinil. Tolerability was assessed by the reported adverse events, clinical laboratory testing, vital sign measurements, ECGs, and physical exams. In this crossover study of patients with treated OSA, overall systemic exposure after armodafinil 200-mg administration was greater than that following modafinil 200-mg administration after both single and multiple doses. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the 2 drugs were notably different and did not meet the FDA criteria for bioequivalence. The study population was 83.3% male (35/42) and 76.2% white (32/42) with a mean (SD) age of 47.0 (8.30) years and a weight range of 66.3 to 127.4 kg. Plasma drug concentration-versus-time curves suggested comparable terminal half-lives (mean [SD] values were 16.5 [4.44] and 14.4 [3.22] hours for armodafinil and modafinil, respectively) but higher systemic exposure with armodafinil than modafinil (mean [SD] AUC(0-infinity) values were 108.8 [31.66] and 66.4 [20.06] microg . h/mL for armodafinil and modafinil, respectively), as indicated by the high geometric mean ratios for the AUC (the AUC(0-infinity)) ratio after a single dose was 1.64 [95% CI, 1.60-1.68; P < 0.001], and the AUC(0-tau) ratio after multiple doses was 1.69 [95% CI, 1.65-1.72; P < 0.001]) and, to a lesser extent, the ratio of the maximum plasma drug concentration after multiple doses (C(max) ratio = 1.37 [95% CI, 1.33-1.41; P < 0.001]). In addition, the ratios and associated 90% CIs for Cmax (137 [1.341.40]) and AUC(0-tau) (169 [1.66-1.75]) after multiple-dose administration did not meet the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria for bioequivalence (ie, ratio of geometric means between 80% and 125%). Reported adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. The most frequently reported adverse events while receiving armodafinil or modafinil were headache (29% and 2%, respectively), diarrhea (12% and 5%), nausea (10% and 2%), and dizziness (10% and 5%).
